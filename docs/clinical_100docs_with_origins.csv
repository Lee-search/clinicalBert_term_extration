      Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a common disease associated with multiple complications and an
      increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Also, it is a heavy economical
      burden on society. 1st degree relatives of patients with T2D have an increased risk of
      developing T2D. This risk can be modified by the ingested diet: a traditional north European
      diet rich in saturated fat increases the risk, while a Mediterranean diet rich in
      monounsaturated fat protects from development of T2D and cardiovascular disease.

      T2D is a part of the metabolic syndrome consisting of T2D, hypertension, adipositas,
      dyslipidemia and steatosis. The pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome is partly explained by
      fasting dyslipidemia, postprandial dysmetabolism (derangement of lipid and carbohydrate
      metabolism) and impaired metabolic flexibility. Partly, it can be explained by a chronic
      low-grade inflammation in peripheral tissue. The dysmetabolism and the inflammation are
      correlating entities exerting their influence through common biochemical pathways. This is
      established in patients with T2D, but sparsely studied in healthy relatives of patients with
      T2D.

      In this project, the investigators will study postprandial dysmetabolism, inflammation,
      oxidative stress, adipocytokines, incretins, appetite regulating hormones and the expression
      of the genes involved in above mentioned. We will compare healthy 1st degree relatives of
      patients with T2D with healthy controls with no family history of T2D and look into
      differences in the response to meal stimulation with respectively saturated and
      monounsaturated fat. The subjects will be thoroughly examined with a hyperinsulinaemic
      euglycaemic clamp and a DEXA scan. Before and after the meal stimulation, we will perform
      calorimetry (in order to determine the metabolic rates), take blood samples and perform
      muscle and fat tissue biopsies. The biopsies will be used for studies of a vast number of
      genes.

      The project will give us new valuable knowledge about the interaction between the
      intermediate metabolism and the innate immune system and the early pre-diabetic changes in
      the 1st degree relatives of patients with T2D. In the long run, the project will contribute
      to improving our guidance and treatment of persons at risk of developing T2D.

      Patients need vitamin D which is normally produced in the skin in response to ultraviolet
      light from the sun. Vitamin D is important for calcium absorption and good bone health.
      Physicians have been using sunscreens to protect patients from skin cancer and the aging
      effects of sunlight for a least a half a century. Dermatologists have promoted sunscreen use
      to restrict sunlight exposure especially in white Caucasians. If this behavior is done 100%
      of the time when outdoors individuals may suffer from vitamin D deficiency. It is impossible
      to influence persons' behavior to wear sunscreens all the time when outdoors. With the use of
      sunless tanning agent (DHA), once a week, we can obtain a continuous sunscreen in the top
      layer of the skin that will not wash off, can't be removed with soap and water, or removed by
      perspiration. Under these circumstances we can answer the scientific question, will sunscreen
      use inhibit the production of vitamin D in the skin?

      There are two parts to this study: (1) an information gathering phase leading to development
      of a new decision aid (phase 1); and (2) a study to test the newly developed decision aid
      (phase 2).
     
      Phase 1 - The purpose of this part of the research study is to conduct individual interviews
      and focus groups (group discussions) to learn more about the things or behaviors that help
      men to stay healthy and the decision making process for prostate cancer screening. We will
      discuss men's general health concerns, knowledge, beliefs, and concerns regarding prostate
      cancer and screening for prostate cancer. We will use the results from this study to develop
      a decision aid to help first-degree relatives of prostate cancer patients make informed
      decisions about whether to undergo testing or not to undergo testing for prostate cancer. The
      new decision aid will include a digital videodisc (DVD) and an accompanying booklet. We hope
      to learn from you the needs and concerns of first-degree relatives, what information to
      include in the decision aid, what language to use, and the best way to present this
      information.

      Phase 2 - The purpose of this part of the research study is to test the usefulness and
      acceptability of a new decision aid we developed specifically for first-degree relatives
      (FDRs) of prostate cancer patients. We will compare the new decision aid to another widely
      available decision aid that was not developed specifically for first-degree relatives. The
      goal is to see if the new decision aid will change knowledge (about prostate cancer and
      screening) and increase satisfaction with decision making (intention or decision made). If we
      find some evidence that the new decision aid is relevant (useful) and acceptable, we will
      then do a larger study with several hundred men to determine more definitively whether the
      new decision aid is better than already existing general decision materials and for which men
      it works best.

      Because the correct decision (whether to undergo screening or not to undergo screening) is
      not known at this time, the goal of decision aids is to present both (in a balanced manner)
      the potential harms and benefits of screening. Therefore, this study focuses on the informed
      decision making (knowledge and satisfaction with decision).

      Bupropion has been used successfully and safely for smoking cessation in adults. It was also
      used in very few studies among adolescent population. Our hypothesis is that Bupropion would
      be effective and safe among the adoelscent psychiatric population. A double-blind randomized
      controlled-trial will be held to determine that.
     
      The study will be conducted in Geha Mental Health Center. A total of 80 adolescent
      non-psychotic smokers will be recruited for this study. A smoker is defined as a cosumer of
      at least 5 cigarettes daily. A total of 80 patients will be recruited from the adolescent
      psychiatric wards or the adolescent clinics of the mental health center. The study group
      (N=40) will receive bupropion SR and the control group (N=40) will receive placebo
      medication. Age of participants will range from 13-20 years. Both genders will be included
      and all ethnic origins.

      All participants will receive a detailed explanation about the study, its aims, the bupropion
      therapy, including possible adverse effects of the drug and other possible therapeutic
      alternatives. They will receive a leaflet summarizing all relevant data and information. Then
      they and their parents will sign an informed consent to participate in the study.

      Procedure The mental health center's pharmacist will encapsulate the bupropion tablets, which
      will be supplied by the manufacturing company. The study capsules will all be kept in the
      hospital's pharmacy. Randomization will be performed using a random number table. The code
      will be held solely by the principal investigator, and will be broken in the end of the
      study's follow-up period, unless an emergency occurs. All participants will be given the
      telephone number of the principal investigator for any questions or problems arising.

      The subjects in both groups will be double-blindly randomized to receive either bupropion or
      placebo. The assignment to each group will be done randomly in order to ensure location
      concealment. For subjects receiving bupropion, the dose will be 150 mg/d for the first three
      days, increasing for 150 mg twice daily, continued for a period of eight weeks. In case of
      intolerable side effects, the dosage will be decreased to 150 mg daily.

      On recruitment, all subjects will be screened for-

        -  Medical history

        -  Vital signs

        -  Height

        -  Weight

        -  Place of birth

        -  Tobacco use history

        -  Alcohol and substance abuse

        -  Urine pregnancy test (for girls only)

        -  Kiddie schedule for affective disorders and schizophrenia (K-SADS-PL) screening tool
           (37).

      Possible electrocardiographic side effects of bupropion that have been reported in the
      literature were tachycardia and conduction delays (widened QRS complex and/or prolonged QTc
      interval), but none of these delays progressed to a life-threatening arrhythmia, even in case
      of overdose.

      Exclusion criteria will be:

        -  Psychiatric disorders in Axis I of DSM IV (38) (for the control group)

        -  Smoking less than 6 cigarettes a day

        -  Using other tobacco products other than cigarettes

        -  Using any other smoking cessation treatment

        -  Exhaled CO level of less than 10 ppm

        -  Convulsive disorder or a history of seizures

        -  Mental retardation and a lack of ability to give an informed consent

        -  Concurrent use of Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO-I).

        -  Anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa.

      All subjects will be evaluated for weight, smoking, substance use, anxiety and depressive
      symptoms at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year. Follow-up phase will be blinded
      as well. Evaluation in these time points will include:

        -  Urine cotinine In addiction to the pharmacological therapy, both groups of the study
           will receive supportive and psychoeducational treatment in the setting of group therapy.
           Supportive psychotherapy focuses on using suggestions and supportive expressions to
           encourage the patient in his goal of quitting smoking. Psychoeducational treatment
           concentrates on educating the patients on the benefits of abandoning smoking and the use
           informative details in regards to that issue.

      The study seeks to use microdialysis and microperfusion techniques to assess the feasibility
      of performing insulin delivery and glucose sensing at a single subcutaneous tissue site.
     
      Glucose management in type 1 diabetic patients comprises the measurement of glucose in
      capillary blood obtained by fingersticking and administration of exogenous insulin in the
      form of a subcutaneous bolus injection or continuous subcutaneous infusion.

      The present study seeks to test an alternative treatment approach that combines glucose
      measurement and insulin delivery at a single subcutaneous tissue site, thereby circumventing
      the need for fingerstick blood glucose monitoring. Microperfusion and microdialysis probes
      are applied in type 1 diabetic subjects to perform insulin delivery and glucose sampling at
      the same adipose tissue site. The feasibility of estimating blood glucose concentrations from
      the glucose levels measured at the subcutaneous insulin delivery site is then assessed during
      an overnight fast and an oral glucose tolerance test.

      This study assesses the effects of bardoxolone methyl (RTA 402) in patients with type 2
      diabetes and chronic kidney disease.
     
      Bardoxolone methyl (RTA 402) is an Antioxidant Inflammation Modulator (AIM) that is
      undergoing clinical testing in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cancer. Bardoxolone methyl
      and other AIMs inhibit immune-mediated inflammation by restoring redox homeostasis in
      inflamed tissues by inducing the cytoprotective transcription factor Nrf2. In the diabetic
      population, adipocytes produce cytokines and mobilize free fatty acids which induce insulin
      resistance. Resultant hyperglycemia and increased cytokine production induces reactive oxygen
      and nitrogen species which in turn induce vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.
      This process causes further activation of NF-kB, creating a vicious cycle of inflammation,
      vasoconstriction, and ischemia, the end result of which is sclerosis in the kidney and
      coronary arteries. By inducing Nrf2 and suppressing redox-driven inflammation, we hypothesize
      that this cycle of inflammation and sclerosis can be abrogated.

      Based on Phase IIa data, we hypothesize that bardoxolone methyl will improve renal function
      through suppression of renal oxidative stress, inflammation and improvement of glomerular
      filtration.

      This study focuses on one of the major health issues of Sub-Saharan Africa: multi-parasitism
      and co-infections. In particular this study aims to elucidate the interaction of helminths
      with HIV.

      There is good reason to suspect a detrimental effect of helminth infection on the course of
      HIV infection. We hypothesize, that treatment of helminths in HIV- and helminth co-infected
      individuals leads to a reduction of HIV viral load. With a lower HIV RNA level one would
      expect a slower decline of CD4 cells and hence also a slower progression of the disease.
      Ideally this would lead to a prolongation of the chronic phase of HIV infection and to a
      delay in the time when anti-retroviral treatment needs to be started.
     
      * Background: On the basis of immunological considerations and in vitro trials on
      co-infections there is strong reason to suspect a detrimental effect of helminth infection on
      the course of HIV. The immunological answer very efficiently evoked by helminth infection is
      aimed at hijacking and suppressing the immune system in order to suit the requirements of the
      specific helminth. This permits helminths to cause chronic infection, often persisting over
      years and allowing some infecting worms to grow to several centimetres of length within their
      host. However, this immune modulation also affects non-related antigens (for example HIV)
      which would actually require a different line of immunological action.

      Some clinical trials have been able to confirm this detrimental effect of helminths on HIV
      infection, while other trials failed to do so. A recent Cochrane review on clinical trials
      with HIV and helminth co-infection found an overall slight reduction of HIV viral load if
      helminth infection was treated. However there was no measurable effect on CD4 count or
      clinical staging of HIV. This might be explained by the fact that these trials were very
      heterogeneous in their set-up and were run for too short a time (max 6 months) to allow
      sufficient answers to these questions.

      According to mathematical models, even a relatively modest reduction of HIV RNA by 0.5 log
      could delay the need to start combined antiretroviral therapy by about 3.5 years and
      potentially prolong the symptom-free phase of HIV-infection by nearly 1 year. On a population
      scale this could lead to substantial savings with regard to drug and clinical costs and on an
      individual level to an invaluable gain in drug-free and ideally also symptom-free life years.

        -  Objective: To assess the impact of presumptive anthelminthic treatment on HIV
           progression in patients infected with HIV in a rural setting with presumed high
           prevalence of helminth infection.

      Neointimal coverage over stent strut is important for preventing the stent thrombosis. But,
      there is no data for the duration of complete formation of neointima om zotarolimus eluting
      stent (ZES). Previously the investigational observational data at 9 months showed most of
      stent strut was covered with neointima. Therefore, the investigators investigated the
      evaluation of neointimal coverage on 3 months after ZES implantation using novel OCT system,
      which is powerful intravascular imaging system having the higher resolution power.
     
      Stent thrombosis is current main issue after introduction of drug-eluting stents and
      theoretically dual antiplatelet therapy should be continued to prevent the stent thrombosis
      until complete reendothelization. Currently, AHA/ACC guideline recommend dual antiplatelet
      should continue at least 3 months in Sirolimus eluting stent (SES) and 6 months in paclitaxel
      eluting stent (PES), but if possible, suggest to use until 12 months.

      Zotarolimus (Endeavor®) eluting stent (ZES) have been recently introduced and focused on
      reducing concern of safety through the biocompatible polymer and rapid drug elution. ENDEAVOR
      II trial showed a 0.5 per cent rate of stent thrombosis at 30 days - with no late thrombosis
      beyond 30 days and no late stent malapposition. In the long term follow up data of Endeavor
      stent, the two-year clinical results of ENDEAVOR I were impressive, with a low TVF and MACE
      rate (2% and 3% respectively) with the absence of reported thromboses after day 14. These
      results speak, especially the lack of stent thrombosis after 14 days, reflect very well on
      the performance and safety of the ZES.

      But, there has been no guideline for the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy in ZES
      although shorter duration of dual antiplatelet therapy could be safe compared to previous
      drug-eluting stents. Also, there is no data how long duration might be taken in completion of
      reendothelialization after ZES implantation in living patients. The most powerful
      histological predictor of stent thrombosis was endothelial coverage. The best morphometric
      predictor of LST was the ratio of uncovered to total stent struts. Because the presence of
      endothelization is not available in in vivo situation and endothelialization is reported to
      be associated with neointimal coverage of stent, the detection of neointima after stent
      implantation could be the main issue to predict the stent thrombosis. Recent data in SES
      using optical coherence tomography (OCT) reported neointimal coverage over a SES at 3-month
      follow-up is incomplete. The rates of exposed struts and exposed struts with malapposition
      were 15% and 6%, respectively. These were more frequent in patients with acute coronary
      syndrome (ACS) than in those with non-ACS (18% vs 13%, p <0.0001; 8% vs 5%, p <0.005,
      respectively).

      Although neointimal coverage could be completely in early period after ZES implantation,
      there is no data for this finding. Therefore, we investigate the evaluation of neointimal
      coverage on 3 months after ZES implantation using novel OCT system, which is powerful
      intravascular imaging system having the higher resolution power. This study may provide
      adequate information on the safety of discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy for
      patients in clinical situations.

      Assess the efficacy of 2 grams of tinidazole given for 5 days with standard dose chloroquine
      to achieve radical cure of Plasmodium vivax within a 90 day follow-up period sufficient to
      justify an IND and formal phase II evaluation.
     
      This is a randomized, open-label study that will treat adult subjects with Plasmodium vivax
      infection with chloroquine for 3 days and tinidazole for 5 days concomitantly to assess
      efficacy for radical cure (clearance of blood and liver stages of infection). There will be
      randomization to a positive comparator arm treated with chloroquine and primaquine
      (definitive radical cure) in order to obtain an estimate of the rate of re-infection during
      the monitoring period in the study population.

      A simple randomization procedure will assign subjects to one of the two arms (treatment arm
      or comparator arm). The ratio of assignment will be 2:1, treatment arm to the comparator arm.
      The exact number assigned to the treatment arm will vary depending on the initial outcome of
      early enrollees per the sequential analysis design of the trial. In the worse case scenario
      of no clear trend developing early, no more than 50 subjects will be required to complete the
      trial in the study drug arm in order to arrive at a conclusion regarding the study drug.

      Follow-up period will be for 90 days. This will allow us to capture essentially all early
      relapses that would occur under normal circumstances, as well as assess if tinidazole may
      delay but not fully eliminate recurrence. Subjects without a recurrence at 90 days will be
      considered to have achieved radical cure.

      This study will use a modified triangular test, a form of sequential analysis designed to
      enable repeated statistical analyses throughout the study recruitment period, while
      maintaining a pre-specified power and type I error. The trial can be stopped as soon as the
      information accumulated is considered sufficient to reach a conclusion and it will limit
      enrollment and exposure to a failing treatment regimen.

      Results of this study will be sufficient to determine whether tinidazole should be designated
      as an ""early kill"" (an ineffective drug for vivax malaria radical cure with no future
      evaluation) or whether it is sufficiently efficacious to warrant further investment with an
      IND and formal phase II study to seek an SNDA.

      The aim of this study is to estimate the efficacy of intracervical versus paracervical block
      on pain experienced during first trimester suction curettage without the use of preoperative

      1. Purpose and Objective:

           To determine the feasibility and short- and long-term efficacy of an empirically-based
           CST intervention (Keefe et al.) with caregivers of patients with primary malignant brain
           cancer.

        2. Study Activities and Population Group:

           The target sample will be 20 caregiver-patient dyads. Using a randomized controlled,
           prospective design, potentially eligible participants will be identified at the time of
           initial consultation (see Figure 1). Outcomes will be assessed at baseline,
           post-intervention (3 months post-randomization), 6 months post-randomization, and every
           4 months up to 2-years in the event that the patient dies.

        3. Data Analysis and Risk/Safety Issues:

      With only 10 subjects per group we do not have statistical power for direct hypothesis
      testing. Nevertheless, p-values will be presented for some analyses (chi-square tests,
      t-tests, and Spearman correlations) simply to aid in interpretation of results. In no way
      will these p-values be used to declare statistical significance or non-significance of the
      test results. Accordingly, the primary focus will be the means, variances, and covariances of
      the study endpoints, as well as the change scores in these endpoints across the study
      intervention and their 95% confidence limits.
     
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and short- and long-term efficacy
      of an empirically-based CST intervention (Keefe et al.) with caregivers of patients with
      primary malignant brain cancer. The target sample will be 20 caregiver-patient dyads. The
      caregiver may be a spouse/partner, family member or friend,. Additional inclusion criteria
      will include: (1) caregiver provides a weekly minimum of 4 hours of caregiving; (2) caregiver
      is 18 years or older; (3) caregiver reading level at or above 8th grade; (4) caregiver
      sufficiently fluent in English; (5) the patient shows evidence of problems in depression,
      fatigue, sleep disturbance, and/or cognitive impairment as per the treating neuro-oncologist;
      (6) the caregiver and patient are willing to be randomized to treatment or usual care
      condition; (7) patient is within 3 months of initial diagnosis; (8) patient has life
      expectancy of at least 6 months or more; (9) the caregiver is willing to participate in
      treatment sessions using a telephone. If a patient dies during the active 12-week study
      phase, then the caregiver will be transitioned to the follow-up phase or removed from the
      study and, if needed, be referred for appropriate psychiatric or psychological treatment.

      Using a randomized controlled, prospective design, potentially eligible participants will be
      identified at the time of initial consultation. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline,
      post-intervention (3 months post-randomization), 6 months post-randomization, and every 4
      months up to 2-years in the event that the patient dies. If the subject is assigned to the
      intervention, they will be asked to complete 12 weeks of a coping skills training
      intervention. The coping skills intervention will consist of six telephone conversations
      during which they will learn strategies to reduce stress. The strategies will include ways to
      improve problem solving, communication skills, and managing activities. The subject will also
      be asked to complete a packet of questionnaires which will take about 1 hour to do. The
      subject will be asked to complete the questionnaires multiple times during the study (before
      the coping skills intervention, during the week after the coping skills intervention, and 3
      months after the coping skills intervention). If the subject is assigned to the usual care
      condition, they will be asked to complete assessments at the same time intervals as
      caregivers in the active coping skills intervention. In either condition, in the event that
      the patient dies, the caregiver will also be asked to complete assessments every four months
      for one year. Patients will be asked to participate in sessions and complete questionnaires
      as they are able to.

      Radiation treatment is very effective for treating cancers of the head and neck, however,
      during the course of treatment, it is common for patients to experience soreness of their
      mouth and throat due to the radiation. When radiation causes inflammation of the inside of
      the mouth, it is called 'mucositis'. There are several mouthwashes that are commonly used to
      prevent and treat mucositis, but none of these have been shown to be superior to another.
      This study is being conducted to see if using a combination of magic mouthwash and sucralfate
      is better than using a single mouthwash called benzydamine at decreasing the burden of
      mucositis.
     
      Sixty patients with head and neck cancer being treated with 6 or more weeks of radiotherapy,
      will be randomly assigned to receive either a combination of magic mouthwash
      (diphenhydramine, dexamethasone and nystatin) plus sucralfate or benzydamine. Patients
      randomized to receive magic mouthwash plus sucralfate will rinse first with 5ml of the magic
      mouthwash for 2 minutes then swallow, followed by rinsing with 5ml of the 1g/5ml sucralfate
      for 2 minutes before swallowing, 4 times daily. Patients randomized to receive 0.15%
      benzydamine HCl will be instructed to rinse with 15ml of the solution for 2 minutes before
      expectorating, 4 times daily. Patients will start the mouthwash regimens prior to the
      initiation of radiotherapy, and stop 2 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy.

      The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) guidelines recommend that HIV infected
      patients who have never received anti-HIV therapy be treated with a triple drug regimen. The
      most commonly prescribed and successful regimen contains the medication efavirenz (EFV).
      However, this regimen may not be an option for everyone, hence alternative regimens are
      needed.

      This study was designed to look at how well different combinations of anti-HIV drugs work to
      decrease the amount of HIV in the blood (viral load) of and allow immune system recovery in
      people who have never received anti-HIV therapy. This study also examined drug tolerability
      and safety for the various drug combinations.
     
      Of the five anti-HIV drug classes, four were recommended as first-line regimens for patients
      who have never received anti-HIV treatment before (treatment naive): nucleoside reverse
      transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs),
      Integrase Inhibitors (INIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs). The U.S. Department of Health and
      Human Services (HHS) guidelines recommend that treatment-naive HIV infected patients be
      treated with a triple drug regimen that includes 2 NRTIs + 1 NNRTI, 2 NRTIs + INI, or 2 NRTIs
      + 1 PI as their initial treatment regimen.

      According to data, an efavirenz (EFV)-containing regimen (2 NRTIs + 1 NNRTI, with EFVas the
      NNRTI) requires fewer pills for the patient, has mild and few side effects, and is more
      effective in reducing viral load than other regimens, making it the preferred choice for most
      patients. However, for some patients, an EFV-containing regimen is not feasible due to side
      effects, acquired NNRTI-resistant HIV virus, or other undesirable effects. For these
      patients, it is necessary to find alternative regimens with comparable safety and efficacy.
      This study examined how well different combinations of anti-HIV drugs work, including safety
      and drug tolerability for various combinations.

      This was a phase III, prospective, randomized study. Participants was randomly assigned to
      one of three different groups (treatment arms)-A, B, or C -each representing a different drug
      combination regimen, none of which contained an NNRTI.

      Arm A: Atazanavir (ATV) + Ritonavir (RTV) + Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
      (FTC/TDF)

      Arm B: Raltegravir (RAL) + FTC/TDF

      Arm C: Darunavir (DRV) + RTV + FTC/TDF

      The duration of this study was between 96 and 192 weeks, depending on when the participant
      enrolled. There were a total of 1,809 participants, approximately 600 per treatment arm.
      Screening and pre-entry evaluations must occur prior to the participant starting any study
      medication, treatments, or interventions. Participants were randomly assigned to their
      treatment groups at the entry visit and must begin treatment within 72 hours of
      randomization. Participants was told which group they were in and what medications they were
      administered. The study drugs were distributed at entry. All drugs were provided by the study
      with the exception of RTV, which would have to be obtained through the participant's primary
      care physician (Group A or C). If a participant was unable to tolerate any of the study
      medications during the course of the study then their doctor could switch them to another
      regimen.

      During the study, participants was asked to return to the clinic at Weeks 4, 8, 16, 24, 36,
      and 48 and then every 16 weeks until the end of the study. They were also contacted by
      telephone during Week 2 to check on their status. Visits were last about 1 hour. At most
      visits, participants had a physical exam and answered questions about any medications they
      were taken. Additionally, participants completed questionnaires addressing their smoking and
      alcohol habits, had blood drawn, and were asked to give urine samples. At some visits,
      participants had to come to the clinic without having eaten for 8 hours. If the participant
      was female and able to become pregnant, a pregnancy test might be given at any visit if
      pregnancy was suspected.

      Some participants of A5257 were asked to participate in an optional metabolic substudy
      A5260s. This substudy took place at only some study sites and continued last up to 144 weeks,
      including time on A5257. The primary focus of this substudy was to examine carotid artery
      intima-media thickness (CIMT) as it relates to both RTV- and RAL-containing regimens.
      Randomization, stratification, treatment assignments, and study visits were as per A5257.

      Friedreich's ataxia (FA) is a rare progressive neurological disorder affecting approximately
      1/30, 000 individuals. No treatment is presently available to counteract the
      neurodegeneration of this extremely severe disease.

      Pioglitazone, a well known PPAR gamma (peroxysome proliferators-activated receptor gamma)
      ligand induces the expression of many enzymes involved in the mitochondrial metabolism,
      including the superoxide dismutases. This agent may be therapeutic by counteracting the
      disabled recruitment of antioxidant enzymes in FA patients. This potential neuroprotective
      agent crosses the brain blood barrier in human.

      Primary objective: To explore the effects of Pioglitazone on neurological function in FA
      patients. We expect neurological benefits taking into account the natural course of the
      disease.

      Population: Subjects for this study will be limited to patients not older than 25 years
      Methodology: Prospective, randomized double-blind trial of Pioglitazone versus placebo in FA
      patients. Patients will be treated two years and will undergo clinical exams and testing
      during three days each six months at the clinical investigation centre.
     
      State of the art Friedreich's ataxia (FA) is a rare progressive neurological disorder
      affecting approximately 1/30, 000 individuals. No treatment is presently available to
      counteract the neurodegeneration of this extremely severe disease. The cardinal feature is a
      progressive gait and limb ataxia. Other commonly associated clinical signs include:
      dysarthria, sensory loss, distal weakness, pyramidal signs, absent reflexes, nystagmus and
      cardiomyopathy. Pes caves, scoliosis, diabetes and decline of vision or audition are also
      found in many patients. The disease often reveals before adulthood and leads to a progressive
      loss of autonomy about ten years after disease onset. FA is recessively inherited with a GAA
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in the first intron of a gene encoding frataxin a
      mitochondrial protein. Decreased frataxin leads to a mitochondrial iron-sulfur protein
      deficiency and hampered signalling pathways for superoxide dismutases, key enzymes of early
      antioxidant defences of the cells. As a result, cultured patient cells are particularly
      sensitive to oxidative insult. One aspect of the pathogenesis in vivo might be explained by
      this phenomenon.

      Pioglitazone, a well known PPAR gamma (peroxysome proliferators-activated receptor gamma)
      ligand induces the expression of many enzymes involved in the mitochondrial metabolism,
      including the superoxide dismutases. This agent may be therapeutic by counteracting the
      disabled recruitment of antioxidant enzymes in FA patients. This potential neuroprotective
      agent crosses the brain blood barrier in human. A clinical study has shown that a daily
      treatment with Pioglitazone during three years induced apparent clinical improvement without
      adverse events in multiple sclerosis patients. Pioglitazone has been shown to possibly act on
      neurodegeneration in humans and animals models thus it appears a promising agent to be tested
      in Friedreich ataxia. This agent also didn't show any peculiar toxicity in cultured human
      cells with low frataxin compared with control. All these facts lead us to propose a clinical
      trial with Pioglitazone in patients with FA. .

      Primary objective: To explore the effects of Pioglitazone on neurological function in FA
      patients. We expect neurological benefits taking into account the natural course of the
      disease.

      Population: Subjects for this study will be limited to patients not older than 25 years
      Methodology: Prospective, randomized double-blind trial of Pioglitazone versus placebo in FA
      patients. Patients will be treated two years and will undergo clinical exams and testing
      during three days each six months at the clinical investigation centre.

      Patients number justification: 20 patients in each group will be enrolled in the study with
      considerations to inclusion possibilities and the Bayes statistical analysis methodology.
      Evaluation of prior distribution of success probability per arm will be based on previous
      literature data and experts consensus.

      Primary endpoint : change in neurological testing as performed using the International
      Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) settled down by the World Federation of Neurology.
      Success will be defined as a stabilisation or improvement on ICARS designed as no more than 2
      points maximum increment on this scale in two years.

      Secondary endpoints include measurements of the following: Neurological score by the
      Friedreich's Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS), gait record and analysis of its components, posture
      study, kinetic study of the upper limbs, speech, oculomotor and auditory disorders,
      functional handicap using the Disability Status Scale (DSS), quality of life by SF-36 score;
      Cardiac involvement (electrocardiography, 24 hours holter, echocardiography with tissue
      doppler) and drug tolerance.

      Benefits expected with this clinical trial: Expected results will be reduced symptoms or
      stabilization of the natural evolution of this threat full progressive disease with bad
      prognosis in patients treated with Pioglitazone. Furthermore, study results will possibly
      contribute in the validation and standardization of new clinical evaluation tools used in the
      follow-up of Friedreich ataxia patients.

      Specific monitoring was initiated in all patients included in the study taking into account a
      potential risk of bladder cancer.

      All patients included in the protocol ACTFRIE, will be asked to participate in the study of
      tolerance. They will receive pioglitazone at a dose of 45 mg per day, until the data on the
      effectiveness or otherwise of this treatment, its side effects in patients with Friedreich's
      ataxia are known by the results of ACTFRIE testing (approximately April 2014).

      Device under Test: The Viacor® Percutaneous Transvenous Mitral Annuloplasty (PTMA) system
      comprises a sterile implantable cardiac device and associated custom accessories to assist
      implantation. The PTMA system is intended to treat functional mitral regurgitation (MR) in a
      heart failure patient by a less invasive method than surgical annuloplasty with greater
      relief of symptoms than medical management alone.

      Study Objective: Functional mitral regurgitation is associated with an adverse prognosis in
      the heart failure patient. The objective of this study is to evaluate whether PTMA is
      effective in reducing mitral regurgitation in heart failure patients and whether this
      reduction is associated with a moderation in the adverse progression of heart failure
      symptoms.

      Hypothesis under Test: Reduction of the severity of functional mitral regurgitation from
      baseline, as defined by a composite improvement of quantitative echocardiographic metrics,
      can be achieved safely with the PTMA device and will be associated with a measurable
      moderation of adverse progression of heart failure symptoms and a moderation of the
      deterioration of exercise capacity.

      Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) is a FDA approved mode of mechanical ventilation.
      This mode of ventilation is currently in routine use in adult, pediatric and neonatal
      intensive care units. The electrical activity of the diaphragm, the largest muscle used
      during respiration, is measured. The ventilator applies support in proportion to the measured
      electrical activity of the diaphragm (Edi). This electrical activity is measured through a
      feeding tube that also has a multiple-array esophageal electrode in it.

      Whenever a patient gets extubated in our MSICU, we conduct a routine extubation readiness
      test. This is standard of care in our ICU. If the patient fails this test, the patient stays
      on the ventilator. If he passes, he gets extubated. We wish to conduct a study during which
      we will monitor the electrical activity of the diaphragm during this test. If the patient
      passes the extubation readiness test, the study is complete. If he fails, he resumes on the
      ventilator. In our study, we would then use the measured signal of the diaphragm to guide the
      ventilator. This mode of ventilation is called NAVA. We do not currently use this mode of
      ventilation in the ICU, but could do so since it is FDA approved. However, we wish to use
      this protocol to gain more expertise with this mode of ventilation in the ICU in a controlled
      fashion. We wish to enroll 20 pediatric patients. Patients in the ICU are routinely on a
      variety of different models of ventilators. Usually, the respiratory therapist determines
      which ventilator will be used. All patients in this study would be on the Servo-I ventilator,
      which is an FDA approved ventilator and capable of monitoring electrical activity of the
      diaphragm and currently used in our MSICU.
     
      1. Specific Aims /Objectives Specific Aim 1: To determine if Edi is a predictor of
           extubation readiness. (Hypothesis: an increase of 20-50% in Edi from baseline (prior to
           ERT) will predict successful extubation.) Specific Aim 2: If the patient fails the ERT -
           We hope to determine if NAVA will provide more information about why the patient failed
           the ERT. (Hypothesis: a decrease in peak inspiratory pressure from baseline (post ERT
           failure) is predictive of high frequency diaphragm fatigue and subsequent successful
           ERT.

        2. Background and Significance The diaphragmatic function plays a pivotal role in the
           patient's ability to breathe on a ventilator, and on the successfulness of weaning from
           a ventilator and extubation. However, diaphragmatic function is not routinely measured
           in the ICU, which we would like to do in this trial.

           When the mechanical load of the respiratory system is too large or continues for a long
           period of time, the diaphragm can develop contractile fatigue[1]. This fatigue can be
           short or long term. Short term is also known as high-frequency fatigue that results from
           the accumulation of inorganic phosphate[2][3], and to a lesser extent intramuscular
           acidosis[4]. On the other hand long term fatigue, otherwise known as low-frequency
           fatigue is consistent with muscle injury[5, 6] and can persist for days. Being able to
           identify what type of diaphragm fatigue is present could help us understand the
           patient's readiness to be extubated.

           Despite the frequent use of mechanical ventilation, determining when to appropriately
           discontinue mechanical ventilation and extubate a patient remains a challenge. Many
           weaning protocols exist but are typically extrapolated from adult studies. These
           protocols can consist of but are not limited to use sprint weaning utilizing a T-piece
           (no support, just oxygen), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or pressure
           support (PSV) trail. Usually, data is gathered through spirometry with a ventilator
           (shallow breathing index, tidal volumes, etc.) and vital signs are recorded [7, 8].
           Despite the use of protocols extubation failure range from 15-24% (Randolph) in the
           pediatric population.

           Investigators have explored physiological evidence of improving lung function to help
           determine the appropriate time to discontinue mechanical ventilation. One notable effort
           by Hubble et al was to obtain dead space to tidal volume ratio (Vd/Vt) to determine
           extubation success after a 30 minute PSV trail prior to extubation[9]. They concluded
           that a Vd/Vt ratio of less than or equal to 0.5 reliably predicted successful extubation
           (96%). However, this only provides one part of the equation - lung function- but not
           necessarily the central nervous system interaction or the work of breathing associated.

           Currently, the MSICU uses an extubation readiness test (ERT). This test determines if
           patients are eligible for discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. This test consist
           of a daily screen of changing the FIO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) to 50% (left at
           current setting if lower than 50%) and decrease the PEEP to 5 cmH2O. Patients unable to
           maintain saturation (SpO2) of 95%, or become tachypneic, or appear uncomfortable failed
           the test; those who maintained SpO2 of 95% or higher have their mode of ventilation
           changed to minimal pressure support (PSV). Minimal PSV was determined by the
           endotracheal tube (ETT) size. Patients were classified as failing the test if at any
           time in the two hour period their SpO2 was less than 95%, their exhaled tidal volume was
           less than 5 mL/kg ideal body weight, or their respiratory rate was outside of the
           acceptable range for age. If the patient fails an ERT they are returned to their
           previous ventilator setting and evaluated for extubation readiness in 24 hours. It is
           understood that sedation is one of the primary caused of extubation failure, however
           there is additional concern regarding the diaphragmatic function. When the mechanical
           load of the respiratory system is too large or continues for a long period of time, the
           diaphragm can develop contractile fatigue[4]. This fatigue can be short or long term.
           Short term is also known as high-frequency fatigue that results from the accumulation of
           inorganic phosphate[5], failure of the membrane electrical potential[6], and to a lesser
           extent intramuscular acidosis[7], but recover quickly. On the other hand long term
           fatigue, otherwise known as low-frequency fatigue is consistent with muscle injury [8,
           9] and can persist for days. Being able to identify what type of diaphragm fatigue could
           lead us to hold on extubation readiness testing as to not re-injury.

           When patients are extubated too early, respiratory failure can occur [10, 11]. When
           extubation is delayed, lengths of time on mechanical ventilation and in the ICU stay
           both increases. This leads to additional respiratory complications such as ventilator
           associated pneumonia and overall lung damage[12]. Thus, the decision to extubate should
           be made on the basis of accurate, objective and reproducible criteria. The diaphragmatic
           activity is likely one of those criteria that are not yet measured. We aim to add some
           additional information to this body of knowledge that may link the respiratory pump
           (diaphragm) to lung function, muscle fatigue, and/or central nervous system depression.

        3. Preliminary Studies/Progress Report To our knowledge there is not previous data
           determining if Edi can predict extubation success. However, there are a few limited
           studies on low and high-frequency diaphragm fatigue in adults and animals. Dr. Laghi and
           colleagues carefully examined 11 who failed extubation and eight adults whom
           successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation. They concluded that weaning itself did
           not cause low-frequency fatigue [13]. While Edi was examined in six health adults at
           high frequency fatigue levels. Edi was found to successfully assess neural drive and
           that diaphragm fatigue did not affect respiratory drive.

           Limits to the studies mentioned above that we plan to address are: none were done in
           children with highly resistive endotracheal tubes, length of mechanical ventilation was
           not examined (low vs. high frequency diaphragm fatigue risk), there was no formal ERT,
           and examination of low and high frequency diaphragm fatigue in the same patient
           population was not done.

        4. Design and Methods a. Study Design In a prospective, blinded (Edi information blinded to
           the team) clinical trail we will study the diaphragmatic activity that occur prior and
           following our standard extubation readiness test (minimum pressure support trial). We
           will examine that diaphragmatic activity by examining the Edi prior to, during, and post
           the trial on every patient who qualifies. Furthermore, patients who fail ERT will be
           ventilated with the NAVA mode of ventilation. The entire protocol will be conducted on
           the Maquet Servo I ventilator

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Giving radiation therapy that uses a 3-dimensional (3-D) image of the tumor to help focus
      thin beams of radiation directly on the tumor, and giving radiation therapy in higher doses
      over a shorter period of time, may kill more tumor cells and have fewer side effects.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as panitumumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some
      block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill
      them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether giving
      capecitabine together with 3-D conformal radiation therapy is more effective with or without
      panitumumab in treating patients with advanced rectal cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying giving capecitabine together with
      radiation therapy to see how well it works with or without panitumumab in treating patients
      with advanced rectal cancer.
     
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To assess the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant capecitabine and concurrent
           3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy with vs without panitumumab in patients with
           advanced K-ras unmutated rectal cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating
      center, T stage (T3 vs T4), tumor localization measured from caudal part of the tumor to the
      anocutaneous line (< 10 cm vs ≥ 10 cm), and number of EGFR gene copies (< 2.9 vs ≥ 2.9).
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive panitumumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 15, 29, 43, and 57
           and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 8-40. Beginning on day 8, patients undergo
           daily fractions of 3-D conformal radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks. Beginning
           approximately 6 weeks after completion of panitumumab and chemoradiotherapy, patients
           undergo surgery.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-33. Patients undergo
           concurrent 3-D conformal radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks. Beginning 6 weeks after
           completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients undergo surgery.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of alitretinoin in the
      treatment of severe chronic hand eczema that does not respond to treatment with potent
      topical steroids.
     
      Chronic hand eczema (CHE)is a distressing disease that poses difficult problems for
      dermatologists. CHE leads to considerable work-absenteeism, disability and exclusion from
      labour market. Conventional treatments, including highly potent topical steroids, yield often
      unsatisfactory results. This study investigates the efficacy and safety of oral alitretinoin,
      a retinoid, in patients who have not responded to avoidance of causative factors, such as
      contact allergens and skin irritants, non-medicated skin care and highly potent topical
      steroids. Eligible patients are randomly assigned to receive alitretinoin or a placebo.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether low-dose simvastatin in combination with
      ezetimibe in comparison to high-dose simvastatin alone, has a beneficial effect on the
      function of the endothelium after an oral fat load in patients with metabolic syndrome.
     
      Metabolic syndrome is defined as a group of cardiovascular risk factors and is mainly driven
      by the epidemic of obesity. High blood lipid levels after a meal may be an important risk
      factor for cardiovascular disease. In this study we will investigate whether simvastatin in
      combination with ezetimibe vs. simvastatin alone, has a beneficial effect on the lipid levels
      after a meal, but more importantly, whether we can measure a difference in function of the
      endothelium. In a small pilot study we already found that the combination had a beneficial
      effect in comparison with simvastatin alone. Now we want to solidify these findings in a
      larger study.

      The Contour Profile Gel Study is designed to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of Mentor's
      Mammary Prostheses in women who are undergoing primary augmentation, primary reconstruction,
      or revision. Safety information on the rate of capsular contracture, rupture, and infection
      will be collected, and used to help determine device safety.

      Approximately 1000 patients at approximately 60 medical centers across the United States were
      enrolled in this research study. These patients were implanted with silicone breast
      prostheses and will be monitored for 10 years to collect information on risks associated with
      the implant surgery as well as changes in the way these patients feel about themselves.
     
      Silicone gel-filled breast implants were introduced in the early sixties and were in
      wide-scale distribution by the time the Medical Device Amendments to the Food Drug and
      Cosmetic Act was passed in 1976. In 1983, gel-filled breast implants were designated as Class
      III devices requiring premarket approval. In May 1990, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      published a proposed request (515(b)) for Premarket Approval Applications (PMA) and in April
      1991 published the final request. This final publication put manufacturers of gel-filled
      breast implants on notice that for continued marketing of gel-filled breast implants, a PMA
      was due to FDA in 90 days from the final publication date.

      A premarket approval (PMA) for the Mentor gel-filled breast implants was filed with the FDA
      in July 1991. At the FDA General and Plastic Surgery Advisory Committee meeting in November
      1991, the committee recommended the submission of additional information to establish the
      safety and effectiveness of gel-filled breast implants.

      In January 1992, the FDA Commissioner announced a voluntary moratorium of the sale of
      gel-filled breast implants to allow the advisory panel time to assess additional information.
      In April 1992, the moratorium was lifted but only for reconstruction and revision patients.
      Every patient implanted had to be part of an adjunct study, and had to be offered
      participation in a registry of gel-filled breast implant patients. In order to be implanted
      with gel-filled implants for augmentation, women had to be enrolled in a core clinical study.

      In September of 2000 the Core Gel study began, leading the way to the November 2006 FDA
      approval of the Core Gel implant or Memory Gel breast implant.

      The objective of the Contour Profile Gel Study, which started in 2002 is to determine the
      safety and effectiveness of the Silicone Contour Profile Gel Mammary Prostheses in women who
      are undergoing primary breast augmentation, primary breast reconstruction, or revision. In

      Opportunistic infections are caused by bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi or viruses that do not
      normally cause infections in people with healthy immune systems. Some of these infections can
      cause public health concerns, especially in areas with limited access to treatment. People
      who acquire opportunistic infections usually have diseases that affect their immune systems,
      such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or do not have enough white blood cells to fight
      the infection. However, some people acquire opportunistic infections even though they have
      normal amounts of white blood cells and are free from known diseases that harm their immune
      systems. This study will investigate some of the reasons that otherwise healthy people get
      opportunistic infections to learn more about why some people are more likely to have them.

      This study will include up to 210 HIV-negative males and females older than 18 years of age
      who have opportunistic infections. The patients will be drawn from multiple sites in Thailand
      and Taiwan including Khon Kaen University Hospital, Siriraj Hospital, Ramathibodi Hospital,
      National Taiwan University Hospital, National Cheng-Kung University Hospital

      Patients will undergo an initial evaluation that will include a physical examination, medical
      history, and blood and urine testing. Additional tests will be conducted if the researchers
      consider that the tests are medically necessary to treat the opportunistic infection; the
      results of the tests will be reviewed and saved for study purposes. Depending on the severity
      of the infection, the initial evaluation may take more than 1 day to complete.

      After the evaluation, patients will be given standard and appropriate medicines to treat the
      infections.

      Patients will return for follow-up visits to allow researchers to monitor their condition and
      to assess how well the patient is responding to the treatment. Patients will be evaluated by
      the study researchers at least once a year for 2 years following the initial treatment.

      ...
     
      The acquisition of opportunistic infections has been causally linked to innate and acquired
      immunodeficiencies. We have recently identified a population of Asian women with
      autoantibodies to interferon gamma (IFN?), all of whom were diagnosed by virtue of
      nontuberculous mycobacterial infections. Similar patient populations have been reported from
      Thailand, and we have found similar autoantibodies in anonymous serum samples from there. In
      addition, many of the Thai patients who have disseminated or lymphatic nontuberculous
      infections have had other opportunistic infections (OI), such as salmonella, penicilliosis,
      and histoplasmosis. However, they have normal lymphocyte counts and are human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative. Therefore, the identification of autoantibodies to a
      critical cytokine, the occurrence of opportunistic infections, and the lack of other common
      explanations suggests that this is an important population to study. We propose to enroll
      patients in a natural history study of non-HIV opportunistic infections to explore the
      presence of autoantibodies to cytokines, and to examine potential immunogenetic factors
      influencing the development of this disease. Plasma, cells, and DNA samples will be obtained
      and stored for use in this study. This study will accrue up to 265 patients over 5 years as
      per the protocol with follow up for 15 years on each patient, sample size justification and
      the groups described in the protocol.

      RATIONALE: Biological therapies, such as lymphokine-activated killer cells, may stimulate the
      immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as Gliadel wafer, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known
      whether lymphokine-activated killer cells are more effective than Gliadel wafer in treating
      patients with glioblastoma multiforme.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well
      lymphokine-activated killer cells work compared with Gliadel wafer in treating patients with
      newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme that can be removed by surgery.
     
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To compare the side effects, including infections and/or abnormal healing at the surgery
           site, associated with intralesional lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells vs
           polifeprosan 20 with carmustine implant (Gliadel® wafer) as consolidation therapy for
           patients with newly diagnosed resectable glioblastoma multiforme.

        -  To compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to age (< 50 vs ≥ 50 years of age), Karnofsky
      performance status (70-80% vs 90-100%), use of corticosteroids > 4 mg/day (yes vs no), and
      progressive disease during first-line therapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo intracranial placement of polifeprosan 20 with carmustine
           implant (Gliadel® wafer) at the time of therapeutic craniotomy.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo leukapheresis to obtain autologous lymphokine-activated killer
           (LAK) cells, followed 3-7 days later by therapeutic craniotomy. The autologous LAK cells
           are then instilled into the tumor bed cavity at the time of therapeutic craniotomy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.

      This study is designed to provide information on patients' immune response after exposure to
      transfused blood.

      Blood transfusions may have opposite immune effects on patients. One is sensitization. The
      other is immunosuppression. The magnitude of these effects in patients who are not on
      chemotherapy is unknown.

      These effects are thought to be due largely to white blood cells present in the transfusion
      product. ""Leukofiltration"" and ""gamma-irradiation"" are the special treatments that deplete
      white blood cells. A combination of leukofiltration and gamma-irradiation pretreatment of
      donor blood is thought to deplete the white blood cells most effectively.

      In this study, patients scheduled for cardiac surgery are randomly assigned to receive blood
      products pretreated in one of three ways: untreated, filtered or filtered and irradiated. If
      their physician orders transfusions, they will receive products assigned to their group.
      Patients are asked to provide two blood samples during the 4 weeks after surgery.

      Studies will measure changes in antibody to HLA and in cells that regulate the immune
      response. The levels of sensitization and immunosuppression will be correlated to the
      transfusion products received.
     
      Blood transfusions may have opposite immune effects on patients. One is sensitization. The
      other is immunosuppression. The magnitude of this problem in patients who are not on
      chemotherapy is unknown.

      Of patients who do receive donor blood, 50-90 percent become sensitized (make antibody) to
      HLA proteins present on white blood cells in the donor blood. This is an undesired effect in
      patients who need an organ or stem cell transplant, as it increases the risk of rejection.
      Another effect of receiving a blood transfusion, immunosuppression, causes a decreased immune
      response that compromises patients' ability to fight off infection or tumor cells.

      These effects - sensitization and immunosuppression - are thought to be due largely to white
      blood cells present in the transfusion product. Doctors order specially pretreated blood
      transfusions that have been depleted of white blood cells with the aim of minimizing risks in
      an ""immunocompromised"" patient. ""Leukofiltration"" and ""gamma-irradiation"" are the special
      treatments that deplete white blood cells. A combination of leukofiltration and
      gamma-irradiation pretreatment of donor blood is thought to deplete the white blood cells
      most effectively. Therefore, blood is pretreated both ways before it is given to patients who
      need a stem cell transplant or others who are immunosuppressed.

      Sometimes the pretreated leukofiltration and gamma-irradiated blood is used for ""regular""
      patients who are not immunocompromised so the blood is used before it expires and not wasted.
      However, doctors do not know for sure whether these expensive pretreatments are really
      beneficial for ""regular"" patients such as those undergoing cardiac surgery and whether they
      would change the risk of developing sensitization or immunosuppression.

      In this study, patients are randomly assigned to receive blood products pretreated in one of
      three ways: untreated, filtered or filtered and irradiated. If their physician orders
      transfusions, they will receive products assigned to their group. Patients are asked to
      provide two blood samples during the 4 weeks after surgery. Studies will measure changes in
      antibody to HLA and in cells that regulate the immune response.

      It is unknown which treatment (leukofiltration with or without gamma-irradiation compared to
      no pretreatment) is most beneficial in patients who are not immunosuppressed.

      This study is designed to provide information on patients' immune response after exposure to
      transfused blood. This information may be useful to caring for patients in the future who
      require transfusion for cardiac surgery.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of lodenafil carbonate in patients with
      coronaropathy, evaluating the response of the body facing physical effort, including both
      heart and respiratory components, with and without use of lodenafil carbonate 80mg.
     
      Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (iPDE5) are effective drugs to treat erectile dysfunction
      (ED).

      ED is linked to several factors, like advanced age and diabetes as predominant in its
      incidence. In addition, ED can be an early manifestation of cardiovascular diseases.

      Among the iPDE5 existing in the Brazilian market there is a new molecule which called
      lodenafil carbonate. It was recently approve and release for use in Brazil, and has similar
      effectiveness and adverse reactions comparing with other drugs from the same family.

      The molecule was evaluated with respect to possible changes in heart rate, blood pressure and
      QT interval, and the results point out excellent cardiovascular safety profile.

      There is a corelated incidence between patients with coronary artery disease and erectile
      dysfunction. Although patients with stable angina and, under appropriate clinical treatment
      did not show increase in cardiovascular risks during sexual intercourse, the increased
      incidence of erectile dysfunction in this population determines a specific group of patients
      with high potential for use iPDE5.

      Therefore it is essential that any new phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors should be evaluated in
      patients with coronary artery disease, especially in heart rate, during physical effort.

      The main objective is to develop pharmacokinetic methods for individual dose adjustment of
      the global immunosuppressive treatment (cyclosporine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and
      everolimus, taking into account the pharmacokinetic interactions), in order to optimise the
      efficiency and reduce the potentially severe sides effects of these drugs.

      Forty five heart-transplant patients are to be included in this phase IV study to obtain a
      minimum of 10 patients treated with tacrolimus-mycophenolate, 10 with
      cyclosporine-mycophenolate and 20 with everolimus-cyclosporine.

      Ten to 11 blood samples will be collected within the 8 to 12 hours post-dose in each patient
      and the immunosuppressive drug concentrations will be measured by LC-MS/MS.

      The pharmacokinetic models and Bayesian estimators thus developed will provide tools for
      individual dose adjustment of immunosuppressive drugs simultaneously, at different
      post-transplant periods, using the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) estimated
      using a limited number of time-points (2 or 3).
     
      For each heart transplant patient, 10 to 11 blood samples (5 mL each) will be collected
      following dosing of he immunosuppressive drugs (at T0, T20', T40', T60', T90', T2h, T3h, T4h,
      T6h, T8h and T10h + T12h for inpatients), at several post-transplant periods (7 to 15 days, 1
      month, 3 month and 1 year after transplantation). One more blood sample will be taken at
      D7-14 for pharmacogenetic analyses.

      Epistaxis is a common problem among people of all ages and backgrounds. However, occasionally
      epistaxis can be severe enough to require emergency room admission. Among the treatment
      options for epistaxis, nasal packing is the most common approach. This approach requires a
      return visit to the clinic for removal of the packing. Additionally, there is a great deal of
      pain during the insertion and removal of this packing. This study aims to justify the further

      This study will compare and analyze the difference between hepatectomy at deep and complex
      sites(adjacent to major blood vessels) of patients with HCC and PRFA prognosis, recovery
      after treatment as well as incidence of complications so as to establish treatment standards
      of HCC at these sites.
     
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a serious disease with high incidence at home and abroad
      still shows a rising trend. In recent decade, the overall survival rate of the disease has
      entered a platform stage with little advance despite diversified methods of treatment. The
      prognosis of HCC is not so satisfying. In recent years, lots of clinical practice and a small
      amount of evidence-based medicine show that: ①.Surgical treatment is still the preferred
      choice of the treatment of HCC. ②. The standardization of comprehensive treatment should be
      put in top priority in current treatment of HCC. Rational treatment methods should be adopted
      in accordance with specific conditions of patients. The best and latest treatment methods
      should also be provided to improve the efficacy to the largest extent for the benefit of the
      majority of patients with HCC.

      Today, tumor remaining in a patient after therapy with curative intent(eg. surgical resection
      for cure ) is categorized by a system known as R classification. That is shown: RX: presence
      of residual tumor can not be assessed; R0: no residual tumor; R1: microscopic residual tumor;
      R2: macroscopic residual tumor; The residue with the application of R classification not only
      refers to both residual tumor at the margin of surgical excision but also residue in distant
      metastasis. The higher R classification is, the worse the prognosis becomes.

      Most studies have been leaded a good result By now that percutaneous radiationfrequency
      ablation(PRFA) is efficacious and safe for patients with HCC. In patients with HCC smaller
      than 3cm, PRFA may be comparable to suegical resection in long-term outcome.

      At present, radical resection (for the final R0 or R1) performed in HCC at most deep and
      complex sites (including caudate lobe HCC, 8th segment hepatoma adjacent to the trunk of
      inferior vena cava, hepatic vein and portal vein, etc) often lead to serious damage to major
      blood vessels (i.e., hepatic vein, short hepatic vein, portal vein and inferior vena cava)
      and hemorrhage during surgery. Therefore, when the surgeon performs surgery near major sites,
      he should excise as few normal liver tissues as possible to avoid above-mentioned hazard.
      However, the resection margin may not be complete and thus affect radical effect. In
      addition, as the tumor is rather deep located, lots of normal liver tissues on the surface of
      the tumor are excised with massive bleeding and serious damage. In view of this situation,
      the surgeon will adopt some alternatives (PRFA is rather common) to achieve the efficacy
      similar to liver excision and greatly reduce the risk of vascular injury and some
      complications like hepatic insufficiency. However, there are no studies on the efficacy
      comparison between this treatment method and the efficacy of liver excision, time to
      recurrence (TTR)stage, disease-free survival and overall survival condition.

      This study will compare and analyze the difference between hepatectomy at deep and complex
      sites of patients with HCC and PRFA prognosis, recovery after treatment as well as incidence
      of complications so as to establish treatment standards of HCC at these sites.
     Hepatocellular Carcinoma :

          -  Identify patients with HCC in accordance with the clinical diagnostic criteria of HCC
             passed at the Chines Eighth National Live Cancer Academic Conference. Patients with
             HCC shall be diagnosed with pathology. There is at least one measurable lesion.

          -  Hepatoma involved in this research at complex site is located at the eighth segment of
             liver, the substantial depth of liver below hepatic integument adjacent to the trunk
             of inferior vena cava, hepatic vein and portal vein. The tumor is located at hepatic
             caudate lobe. The maximal diameter < or=3m, AJCC/UICC-TNM stage is stage II and above.
             Lesions are determined by three senior hepatobiliary experts independently, therefore
             radical resection is possible. There is no possibility of extra-hepatic metastasis and
             tumor thrombus of portal vein, hepatic vein, vena cava and bile duct.

          -  Criteria of liver function: Child A level, serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit
             of normal value, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase ≤ 2 times the
             upper limit of normal value. It's appropriate to perform liver resection and minimally
             invasive treatment.

          -  No dysfunction in major organs; Blood routine, kidney function, cardiac function and
             lung function are basically normal.

      RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin and dexamethasone,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) together
      with bortezomib may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bortezomib together with doxorubicin
      and dexamethasone works in treating patients with multiple myeloma that has relapsed or not
      responded to treatment.

      PATIENT POPULATION: Patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma requiring therapy
      will be invited to participate in this study. Eligible patients will be >18 years old and
      able to give fully informed consent. Patients must have a Performance Score (PS) of 0-3
      (ECOG), measurable serum and/or urine paraprotein, or serum free light chain, bilirubin value
      of less than one and a half times the upper limit of normal with ALT/AST values less than two
      and a half times the upper limit of normal. Patients with non-secretory multiple myeloma are
      excluded from this study.
     
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the response (partial and complete response) in patients with relapsed or
           refractory multiple myeloma receiving bortezomib, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and
           dexamethasone (PAD) after prior treatment with a maximum of 6 courses of vincristine,
           doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (VAD) or VAD-like regimen.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the safety and toxicity of PAD therapy in these patients.

        -  To determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of these patients.

        -  To compare the original response to VAD with the response obtained with PAD as assessed
           by percent fall in paraprotein or Bence Jones Protein, lowest level of abnormal protein
           achieved, and duration of response in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      STUDY DESIGN & METHODOLOGY:

      This is a non-randomised, open labelled phase II trial in patients with relapsed or
      refractory multiple myeloma. Patients will be treated with: Bortezomib 1.3mg/m^2 bolus IV
      injection days 1, 4, 8 & 11 + Dexamethasone 40mg po on days 1, 2, 3, 4 + Doxorubicin
      9mg/m^2/day IV continuous infusion over days 1 - 4. In addition, for the first cycle only,
      Dexamethasone will also be given at 40mg po on days 8 - 11 and 15 - 18.

      Each treatment regimen will continue for a minimum of four - and up to six - cycles of 21
      days (maximum response and 1 cycle).

      This study planned to recruit a total of 69 patients in up to 8 centres in Ireland and the
      UK.

      Patients will be enrolled in three groups of 23 patients:

        -  Relapsed patients, previously treated with VAD or VAD like regimen (VAMP, C-VAMP and
           Z-Dex are examples of VAD like therapy) and who have had autologous transplants at least
           1 year previously. Patients may proceed directly to PAD therapy or have had a maximum of

      treatment is a valuable alternative in the treatment of de novo kidney transplant recipients.
      Furthermore, by investigating the side effects in both arms it will be possible to decide, if
      the absence of calcineurin inhibition and lack of nephrotoxicity will outweigh the adverse
      effects of Rapamycin. With the obtained information it will be possible to plan a larger

      Preterm birth is the most common and costly complication in obstetrics. It complicates up to
      11% of all pregnancies and it is responsible for 70% of sick babies. The ideal way to stop
      preterm labor when it occurs (which drug to use) is not known. Currently magnesium sulfate is
      used by about 95% of all practitioners, but recent data suggest magnesium given this way may
      be harmful for the baby's future development. Other drugs such as antiprostaglandin agents
      are very effective in stopping uterine activity, but particularly when used for >48 hours
      have been associated with both maternal and fetal sides effects. Lastly, calcium channel
      antagonists are effective in stopping contractions and have very little in the way of
      maternal and fetal side effects, but less data is available in the United States on their
      use. Because there is no FDA approved drug to stop preterm labor, we purpose to randomize all
      women with preterm labor (20-34 weeks) to receive one of the above three methods of stopping
      preterm labor. The primary outcomes will be to see which agent stops the uterine contractions
      most effectively, for the longest period of time with fewest relapses and results in
      significant prolongation of pregnancy. If one of these agents is clearly superior to the
      other two it would help women avoid early delivery or have significant extension of their
      pregnancy to avoid some of the complications of preterm birth in the baby.
     
      Preterm labor is the most common complication of pregnancy and one of the most catastrophic
      occurring in 10-12% of all pregnancies and accounting for up to 80% of the neonatal
      morbidity1. In addition, the delivery of a very low birth weight baby often leads to a
      reduction in cognitive and academic skills as well an increased in mental retardation by age
      five2,3. While there are many strategies to treat women in preterm labor all of the agents
      which have been used have side effects, acutely prolong the pregnancy only for a few days,
      and there have been no universally accepted treatment for long term prolongation using oral
      tocolytics in the home4,5,6. While beta-agonists have been used for several decades as
      primary agents for acute tocolysis, side effects have led to these agents being relegated to
      adjunctive therapy or in home care program with the programmable subcutaneous pump7.
      Consequently there are no tocolytic agents approved by the FDA for use during pregnancy.

      The most common drug used for acute tocolysis is magnesium sulfate, which is administered
      intravenously to stop contractions8. While it appears to be effective for short-term
      tocolysis it is thought to be not as effective as anti-prostaglandins or calcium channel
      antagonists in quickly suppressing uterine activity. In addition, there has been controversy
      as to adverse effects on the neonate when this drug is used to impede uterine contractions9.
      Some authors feel that it causes adverse neurologic function in the baby where as others feel
      that it is not associated with any increase neonatal morbidity/mortality in premature
      infants9.10. Regardless, for clinicians treating women in preterm labor magnesium remains the
      main stay of therapy.

      Newer developments, however, point to the improved effectiveness of anti-prostaglandin agents
      and calcium channel antagonists as it concerns treating such patients7,11. Calcium channel
      antagonists are just as effective and appear to be safer than magnesium for primary tocolytic
      treatment of women in preterm labor12-14. Tocolytic treatment with anti-prostaglandin drugs
      such as indomethacin, a Cox-1 inhibitor, has demonstrated them to be the most effective and
      most rapid tocolytic agent available15. Initially there were reports of increasing
      complications with the use of this drug16,17. However, it has been shown that these concerns
      are unwarranted if indomethacin use is limited to 48 hours per treatment cycle and the
      amniotic fluid assessed for oligohydramnios; therefore, in pregnancies <32 weeks there ample
      evidence to justify its use as a primary tocolytic18,19,20. This is particularly true with
      the newer agents of this class (Cox-2 inhibitors) which have fewer fetal side effects7,11. In
      sum, however, there are no randomized trials which demonstrate the effectiveness of these
      three types of agents.

      B. Specific Aim

      The purpose of this study is to compare the three categories of clinically used tocolytic
      agents in a prospective study that will allow direct comparison of outcomes in women with
      confirmed preterm labor. While magnesium sulfate tocolysis for acute treatment of preterm
      labor is the standard of care, there appear to be better tocolytic agents with less maternal
      and fetal side effects which could be used as primary agents.

      C. Rationale

      While there is no evidence that primary tocolytic agents such as magnesium sulfate or
      beta-agonist drugs prolong pregnancy extensively when compared to placebo, preterm labor and
      early delivery remain one of the top few health problems in the perinatal field. For that
      reason, investigations to compare available first line agents are warranted. Based on the
      current information in the literature calcium channel antagonists and anti-prostaglandin
      drugs are the best hope to treat acute preterm labor in an effort to significantly prolong
      pregnancy with the fewest adverse effects on mother and baby.

      D. Benefit to Risk Ratio There is no tocolytic agent approved by the FDA and more importantly
      there is no drug used for this purpose that is free of maternal and fetal side effects.
      However, any treatment involves less risk than a preterm delivery. Because of long experience
      in the medical community, magnesium sulfate remains the number one choice of obstetricians
      throughout the United States, but it has a rather high rate of maternal side effects often
      leading to discontinuation of the drug. For acute treatment of preterm labor both calcium
      channel antagonists as well as anti-prostaglandins appear be more effective while having
      equal or better safety profiles for the mother and baby when used appropriately. The benefits
      of effectively prolonging pregnancy for several weeks far outweigh any medication effects to
      the mother or fetus and therefore, make continued investigation in these drugs reasonable.

      E. Patient Population Patients will be recruited from the labor and delivery area of the
      University of Mississippi Medical Center. All patients who meet admission criteria will be
      offered participation in the study.

      F. Materials and Methods

      Patients who are experiencing confirmed preterm labor (regular uterine contractions, usually
      < 5 minutes apart, associated with cervical change such as dilatation and/or effacement)
      would be considered as potential participants.

      After preterm labor has been confirmed and informed consent has been obtained, patients will
      be randomized by the use of sequentially numbered, sealed opaque envelopes to receive
      intravenous magnesium (6gm load plus 6gm/per hour IV to abolish contractions) versus a
      calcium channel antagonist (nifedipine 30mg loading, then 10 - 20mg q 4 - 6 hours) versus
      antiprostaglandin (indomethacin 100mg rectal suppositories may repeat x1 and then 25 - 50mg q
      6 hours over 48 hours). The amount of each tocolytic over time will be recorded. If this
      fails to abolish uterine activity and there is no contraindication to continuing pregnancy
      (eg abruptio placenta, chorioamnionitis, non-reassuring fetal tracing, etc.) subcutaneous
      terbutaline (beta-agonist) will be given subcutaneously (250mg) as an adjunctive measure to
      abolish contractions. As is our routine we will use blood tests, amniotic fluid assessment
      and ultrasound to detect infection or abruptio placenta which would lead to delivery after
      cessation of tocolytic treatment.

      If there is continued failure of tocolysis further treatment will rest with the physician
      although in most cases the pregnancy will be delivered by this time due to continued
      contractions or diagnosis of complications listed above which contraindicate the continuation
      of the gestation.

      Women will be separately randomized dependent on cervical status (0 - 3cm versus 4 - 6cm
      dilatation) to the same three choices. All other hospital management such as corticosteroid
      therapy to promote fetal lung maturity, continuous fetal heart rate monitoring,
      amnioinfusion, etc., and will be same regardless of group assessment, as is our standard of
      care.

      G. Data Analysis

      Data analysis will be by standard statistical methodology.

      VII. Number of Patients Needed:

      A sample size estimation indicates that 240 patients (80 in each group) will be necessary to
      have an 80% power (decreasing deliveries at < 32 weeks by 50%) of detecting a significance of
      < 0.05 in the number of preterm births. Likewise, in the > 4cm group (assuming 90% delivery
      within seven days) 40 patients in each group (120 women) will be necessary to have an 80%
      power of detecting (with a 25% reduction in deliveries with seven days) a significance of <
      0.05. It is anticipated that it will take a time period of approximately two years to enroll
      this number of participants.

      VIII. Research Equipment Needed:

      None

      This pilot study will provide data on the safety and efficacy of the combination of
      Raltegravir (RAL) 400mg BID + Atazanavir (ATV) 300 mg BID in Antiretroviral (ARV)-experienced
      subjects that have a suppressed HIV viral load on a Ritonavir (RTV) boosted Protease
      Inhibitor (PI) based regimen who are then switched to a regimen of RAL 400mg BID +ATV 300mg
      BID.
     
      The purpose of this pilot study is to compare the virological efficacy, as measured by the
      proportion of patients with plasma HIV-RNA below the limit of detection (<50 copies/mL), of
      two ARV regimens; patients are randomized to remain on regimens containing N(t)RTI(s) + PI/r
      or switch to Raltegravir + ATV but without N(t)RTI(s).

      Study Arms:

        1. N(t)RTI(s) based backbone + PI/r

        2. Raltegravir (RAL) 400mg BID + atazanavir (ATV) 300 mg BID

      Antiretroviral (ARV) treatment guidelines currently recommend ARV regimens containing a
      Nucleos(t)ide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors [N(t)RTI(s)] based backbone with a Non
      Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI) or ritonavir boosted Protease Inhibitor
      (PI/r).(1) However, significant toxicity has been associated with N(t)RTI(s) and PI/r
      containing regimens. N(t)RTI(s) can cause lipoatrophy, lipid elevations, renal toxicity,
      neuropathy and lactic acidosis.(1) These toxicities have required clinicians and HIV-infected
      individuals to use alternative ARV regimens that do not use N(t)RTI(s). PIs are known to
      cause gastrointestinal side effects, dyslipidemia, and fat maldistribution
      (lipodystrophy).(1) The DHHS HIV treatment guidelines recommend that PIs should be given with
      a low dose of ritonavir (RTV). RTV is a PI that has an inhibitory effect on cytochrome P-450
      3A4 isoenzyme which metabolizes most PIs. The addition of RTV serves as a pharmacokinetic
      ""booster"" by increasing PI drug concentrations.(1) However, RTV is known to increase PI side
      effects, elevate lipid levels and has significant drug-drug interactions with many
      medications given to HIV+ individuals.(1) These RTV drug interactions can complicate the
      medical care of an HIV-infected individual.

      Raltegravir (RAL) is a recently FDA approved antiretroviral agent that inhibits HIV
      replication by blocking the integration of HIV proviral DNA into the host cell chromosomal
      DNA. RAL does not exhibit cross resistance to other ARV classes and thus has been initially
      used in HIV-infected individuals that are infected with drug resistant HIV strains. Recently
      published data on the use of RAL(2,3)in HIV-infected subjects with known ARV drug resistance
      or those without ARV drug resistance4 demonstrates that RAL is a potent agent, suppressing
      HIV viral loads in the majority of subjects and having excellent CD4 cell responses.(2-4) RAL
      is metabolized through glucuronidation by the uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyl transferase
      1A1 (UGT1A1) enzyme pathway.(5)ATV is a known inhibitor of this enzyme pathway. ATV will
      increase RAL levels,(5) however, the current DHHS HIV treatment guidelines do not recommend a
      change in the dose of RAL if given with ATV as persons receiving ATV and RAL have
      demonstrated good tolerability of the combination and low side effect profiles.(1-3,5)

      The availability of RAL provides an opportunity to examine alternative ARV strategies that
      may be equally efficacious and less toxic than those currently recommended in HIV treatment
      guidelines. Such combinations might include RAL+ATV regimen without a concomitant N(t)RTI(s)
      based backbone and/or the inclusion of RTV. However, there is little data available to date
      regarding such a combination. HIV care providers have already begun to use the combination of
      RAL+ unboosted ATV as the patients they care for are intolerant of RTV or have had major side
      effects/toxicity with N(t)NRTIs. More investigation is required to determine if RAL+ATV is an
      efficacious and safe alternative to RTV boosted PI based ARV strategies. Before a RAL based
      strategy that does not include N(t)RTIs or RTV can be compared to other ARV class strategies
      for long-term efficacy outcomes, preliminary data on a RAL+ATV based regimen is needed. This
      pilot study will provide data on the safety and efficacy of the combination of RAL 400mg BID
      + ATV 300 mg BID in ARV-experienced subjects that have a suppressed HIV viral load on a RTV
      boosted PI based regimen who are then switched to a regimen of RAL 400mg BID +ATV 300mg BID.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the biologic medication alefacept (Amevive)
      is effective and safe in the treatment of Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris.
     
      Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris (PRP) is a therapeutic challenge, and many different medication
      regimens exist to treat the condition. Clinical response is variable, and no single treatment
      has emerged as a leading therapy. Biologic agents have emerged as effective treatments for
      many skin diseases, including psoriasis. Given the clinical overlap between PRP and
      psoriasis, it is logical to attempt to use these agents for PRP. Since the majority of
      patients with PRP are unresponsive to current therapies, new treatment modalities must be
      evaluated. This study will evaluate the treatment of adult 30 years or older with a diagnosis
      of PRP, either subtypes 1 or 2. In this study, the safety and efficacy of alefacept will be
      evaluated in adult patients with PRP refractory to current treatments. Alefacept is a dimeric
      fusion protein containing the CD2 extracellular binding region of human leukocyte function
      antigen-3 (LFA-3) linked to the Fc portion of human IgG1. The drug binds to the T-lymphocyte
      antigen CD2 and blocks its interaction with LFA-3 on antigen presenting cells in the body.
      The CD2/LFA-3 interaction is a key co-stimulatory signal in the activation of T-lymphocytes
      central to the pathophysiology of psoriasis. It is theorized this interaction plays a role in
      the pathophysiology of PRP. Alefacept is currently approved for the treatment of adults with
      moderate to severe, chronic, plaque-type psoriasis. The medication is administered as weekly
      intramuscular injections for 12 week courses. In this study, a dose of 15mg alefacept will be
      administered intramuscularly at weekly intervals for 12 weeks. This is the dosing regimen
      currently approved for the treatment of psoriasis. Patients will be followed for a total of
      24 weeks.

      The purpose of this study is to determine how safe, tolerable and effective the new
      standardised dosage regimen of FERINJECT® infusions is, compared with a well established
      intravenous iron treatment.
     
      Anaemia in inflammatory bowel disease is mainly attributed to iron deficiency. The main cause
      of anaemia in IBD patients is chronic blood loss. This means that the iron storage depot in
      IBD patients is always low and should be replenished. Oral iron therapy is the first choice
      in many cases because of its safety and economy. However, in patients with gastrointestinal
      bleeding, the effectiveness of oral therapy is reduced. Additionally, oral iron preparations
      are frequently associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions.

      According to European Guidelines, the preferred route of iron supplementation in IBD is
      intravenous. Absolute indications for intravenous iron include severe anaemia (Hb <10 g/dL).
      The current study is a part of a programme investigating the efficacy and safety of
      FERINJECT®, a new formulation of parenteral iron (5% weight per volume iron containing ferric
      carboxymaltose in a solution of water for injection).

      The efficacy and safety of FERINJECT® were investigated in a prospective, randomised,
      controlled study conducted in IBD patients. According to the results of this study,
      FERINJECT® provides a faster Hb response, a higher increase in iron storage and a better
      patient tolerance compared to oral preparations. In this study, the iron amount required was
      calculated according to the Ganzoni formula, where 500 mg is the amount of storage iron. To
      simplify the treatment and to make the treatment more effective, a new standardised dosage
      regimen was created. The current study is designed to assess whether this new standardised
      dosage regimen of i.v. FERINJECT® is as safe and effective as the currently used individually
      calculated dosage regimen.

      The efficacy and safety of the new standardised dosage regimen of FERINJECT® will be compared
      with an already established, well-known treatment of IDA with iron sucrose (VENOFER®). Iron
      sucrose (VENOFER®) is assessed to be effective and well-tolerated in the treatment of IDA in
      IBD patients.

      The study is a phase IIIb, multi-centre, randomised, prospective, open-label, controlled
      study performed at 83 study centres in 14 European countries.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the non-inferiority in efficacy of a
      standardised dosage regimen of FERINJECT® compared to individually calculated dosage regimens
      of VENOFER® in the correction of IDA in patients with IBD in remission. The secondary
      objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a standardised correction dose
      regimen of FERINJECT®.

      Approximately 420 patients will be randomised (1:1 randomisation) to receive treatment with
      either a standardised correction dosage regimen of FERINJECT® or individually calculated
      dosage regimens of VENOFER®.

      Screening will start between 14 and 7 days before the first infusion is administered.
      Baseline assessments will be performed on Day 1 before the first infusion.

      During the screening period, patients will be selected based on eligibility criteria.
      Patients who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will
      undergo baseline assessments at Baseline (Day 1) prior to the first dose of study medication.

      Patients randomised to the FERINJECT® group will receive between 500 mg and 2000 mg of
      FERINJECT®, according to their Hb and body weight, in up to 3 infusions. The maximum infused
      weekly dose of will be 1000 mg. For patients in the VENOFER® group, the individual iron
      deficit will be calculated per individual using the modified formula of Ganzoni. Patients
      will receive one infusion of 200 mg of VENOFER® twice a week, up to 11 infusions, depending
      on their calculated iron deficit. Due to the relatively large doses of iron being
      administered, patients will be monitored carefully throughout the study for symptoms of iron
      overload.

      All patients will return for assessment of efficacy and safety at Weeks 4, 8, and 12. The
      maximum study duration for a patient is 14 weeks. Patients who are not anaemic at Week 12
      will be invited to continue to participate in a maintenance study (FER-IBD-07-MAIN), i.e. a
      study of FERINJECT® versus placebo to determine if the treatment of iron deficiency can
      prevent the recurrence of anaemia.

      The aim of this study is to analyze the therapeutic effect of adjuvant Licartin therapy after
      resection.Patients receiving curative resection (R0) were randomized to postoperative
      Licartin group and no Licartin group. The time to recurrence ,the overall survival as well as
      the incidence of complications after therapy was observed to confirm the role of adjuvant
      therapy of Licartin.
     
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents a major health care challenge in the present era,
      with its incidence rate of 71128 cases and the mortality rate of 679871 cases during 2007 in
      the world. Although liver transplantation, resection and locally ablative therapies remain
      useful treatment preference in patients with early HCC, but they often cannot be availed
      because of either disease progression or outgrowth of treatment criteria, especially for
      liver resection. Moreover, after resection, recurrence of liver tumor can be expected in as
      many as 70% of patients within 5 years which leading to the unsatisfactory long term survival
      of patients with HCC, hence prevention and effective management of recurrence are undoubtedly
      the major strategies to prolong the survival. And until now although a lot of different
      adjuvant therapies had been tried in the clinic, including TACE, immunotherapy and antivirus
      therapy etc. their role in preventing recurrence remain controversial.

      Licartin (generic name, [131I]metuximab injection), a member of CD147 family and a
      therapeutical anti-HCC radioimmunologic agent, generated by labeling of 131I with murine
      monoclonal antibody (mAb) target fragment HAb18 F(ab_)2, was approved as a new drug for
      clinical therapy of primary HCC by China State Food and Drug Administration for its good
      concentrate in the tumor region and safe and effective treatment of HCC. Previous RCT study
      indicated that Licartin prevented post-Orthotopic liver transplantation(OLT) tumor recurrence
      in advanced HCC patients exceed Milan criteria. The recurrence rate significantly decreasing
      by 30.4% at 1-year follow up in the OLT group compared with those in the control group showed
      that Licartin may be a promising drug for preventing tumor recurrence after liver
      transplantation. But less information is known about its role as an adjuvant therapeutic drug
      after liver resection. To determine the clinical efficacy of Licartin for preventing tumor
      recurrence after liver resection, we set up a randomized, controlled trial in patients who
      were definitely diagnosed with HCC and who were successfully treated with liver resection.

      Patients with HCC who received curative liver resection (R0)and with positive expression of
      HAb18G/CD147 in the HCC tissues were randomly assigned 1:1 by the doctors to receive
      placebo(control group) or Licartin (treatment group). All patients in the treatment group
      received Licartin 3 times at an interval of 28 days beginning from the 4th week after liver
      resection. The outcomes of patients were evaluated during the 3-years follow up.

      This study is a preliminary study designed to determine the safety and effectiveness of HFCWO
      using the InCourage vest system as an airway clearance technique for the treatment of CF. The
      study will compare HFCWO to the most commonly used airway clearance technique in Canada,
      namely the Positive Expiratory Pressure technique in patients with CF over a period of one
      year. As this is a preliminary study, it will not be able to determine if the vest is
      equivelant to PEP, but will provide the information needed to plan a larger study to answer
      that question.
     
      Objective This is a pilot study to evaluate the long-term clinical efficacy of high frequency
      chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) using the inCourage vest system, compared to positive
      expiratory pressure mask (PEP) in the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis.

      Study Design This is a one year prospective multi-centre randomized controlled trial of HFCWO
      versus PEP as airway clearance techniques in patients with cystic fibrosis. Number of
      respiratory exacerbations will be compared between the two treatment arms. Slope of percent
      predicted in FEV1, activity level, quality of life, cost analysis and subject satisfaction
      will also be compared.

      Number of subjects Enrollment will be completed after 170 subjects have been recruited,
      approximately 85 in each arm.

      Number of sites The study will involve between 14 CF centres in Canada.

      PERSCRIBED AIRWAY CLEARANCE TECHNIQUE The test airway clearance technique is the

        -  High Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation using the InCourage Vest System. This will be
           compared to

        -  The Positive Expiratory Pressure Mask Technique. Subjects will be randomized to perform
           one of these techniques as their airway clearance technique for the period of the study.

      PRIMARY ENDPOINT Primary: Difference in the number of respiratory exacerbations. (For

      into the liver incisal margin after tumor was resected could reduce the recurrence rate of
      HCC after liver resection.According to this, we proceed this RCT to prospectively observe the
      effect of sustained released 5-FU,and we also want to know whether combined with sustained
      released cisplatin will get better effect in preventing the tumor recurrence,especially in
      short time after liver resection.
     
      150 HCC patients with tumor >5cm, multiple tumor and who cannot accept R0 resection will be
      randomized divided into 3 groups. Group A (50 cases) will be implanted 600mg sustained
      released 5-FU into liver incisal margin after tumor is resected. Group B (50 cases) will be
      implanted 600mg sustained released 5-FU and 60mg sustained released cisplatin. Group C (50
      cases) will be the controlled one which will not be implanted any chemotherapeutic drugs. All
      patients will accepted TACE 30 days after liver resection. We will follow up all patients
      until they are dead or missed connected. Related adverse reaction will be recorded. Total
      survival time (TST) and disease free survival time (DFST) will be calculated too. At the end
      of the study we will compare the difference of adverse reaction, complication, TST and DFST

      The investigators wish to investigate the efficacy of targeted repetitive transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on expressive language in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD).
      In rTMS, magnetic pulses are used to noninvasively stimulate focal areas of cortex of about a
      square centimeter in area. rTMS has been approved in the United States for the diagnosis of
      peripheral nerve conditions.

      Depending on the frequency of stimulation, rTMS can preferentially stimulate or inhibit
      cortical areas. In stroke rehabilitation, for example, inhibition of the contralateral,
      uninvolved hemisphere by low frequency rTMS has improved movement of the affected limbs
      because of less aberrant inhibition of the affected hemisphere by the healthy hemisphere. The
      effects of rTMS has also been investigated and found to be useful in treating refractory
      depression and depression in Parkinson's disease. In addition, rTMS has improved naming in
      patients with Alzheimer's disease and has improved cognitive abilities and memory in
      non-demented older adults. Two studies found that rTMS improved aphasia in patients with
      stroke. While these studies are small, a review of the literature suggests that there may be
      a beneficial role for rTMS in patients with chronic neurological conditions. In addition,
      rTMS appears to be well tolerated, with transient headaches being the most common side
      effect.

      In this small open label study, the investigators wish to investigate the usefulness of
      bilateral stimulation of the brain region termed the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
      in patients with AD who have naming and language deficits.
     
      Subjects for this study will be recruited from Dr. Devi's clinical practice. Eligible
      subjects must have a diagnosis of possible or probable Alzheimer's disease using NINCDS-ADRDA
      criteria. The patient and his or her legally authorized representative need to be available
      to sign the informed consent. The assent of the incapable subject will be obtained prior to
      enrolling the subject in the study.

      Once informed consent and assent are obtained, the subject will have a functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) scan of their brain anytime during the 2 weeks prior to the first
      study visit. At Visit 1, subjects will undergo a baseline battery of cognitive tests lasting
      approximately 30 minutes. Subsequently, the subject will undergo rTMS.

      During the visit, Dr. Devi will locate the area of the brain to be stimulated and mark that
      area of the scalp with an indelible skin marker that will wash out over time. In addition,
      the subjects will be provided with ear plugs to use during stimulation. This process of
      locating the area to be stimulated will take about an hour and will occur once. Then rTMS
      will be started and this procedure will take approximately 20-30 minutes (please see the full
      protocol for a complete description of this process).

      Each rTMS stimulation session will last for about 30 minutes, 2 consecutive days a week for 2
      weeks. Both immediately prior to the onset of the first rTMS session, and just after the end
      of the fourth and final rTMS session, subjects will be tested on their cognitive and language
      skills. These two testing sessions will last 30 minutes each. Subjects will have another fMRI
      scan anytime during the 2 days after the fourth and final rTMS stimulation session.

      Subjects will continue to receive usual care throughout the study period. Any changes to
      usual treatment will be noted in the study file.

      All subjects will be seen again 4 weeks after the final study treatment session and will once
      again undergo the brief cognitive battery and fMRI scan.

      The investigators expect to recruit two subjects at a time for the study and each subject
      will be enrolled for 5 weeks from the baseline visit.
     Alzheimer's Disease :

          -  Subjects must have a diagnosis of probable or possible Alzheimer's disease, diagnosed
             using standardized criteria.

          -  If subjects are determined by the PI to lack decisional capacity to consent to the
             study, a legally authorized representative must be available to sign the informed
             consent on behalf of the subject. In this case the assent of each subject will be
             obtained as well. If at any time the subject withdraws his or her assent, the subject
             will be disenrolled from the study.

          -  Subjects will score at or below 30 on the 60 item naming section of the Boston
             Diagnostic Aphasia and/or below 50% on the Controlled Word Association (CFL) Category

      The purpose of this study is to compare 2 single doses of ivermectin as tablets with 2 single
      applications of malathion 0.5% lotion (Days 1 and 8) in clearing head lice, in patients who
      have recently used standard head lice treatments without success.
     
      Head lice infestation occurs frequently, primarily in children 3 to 11 years of age. In
      recent years an increasing prevalence of lice infestation in schools, day care centres, and
      summer day camps is believed to be partly due to increasing lice resistance to currently
      available standard treatments for pediculosis (infestation with lice). There is a need for
      new effective backup treatments for this common condition of head lice infestation. This is a
      double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, study in several clinical centres comparing
      ivermectin as tablets to malathion 0.5% lotion in the treatment of head lice. All enrolled
      patients participate in the primary phase of the study up to the Day 15 evaluation. Patients
      who are still infested with lice at Day 15 (treatment failures) will enter an extension phase
      and be treated in a double-blind, fashion with the opposite treatment (ie ivermectin or
      malathion). The study hypothesis is that ivermectin will be more effective than malathion in
      clearing head lice infestation , as measured by the proportion of patients who are lice-free
      at Study Day 15.

      The primary objectives will be to measure the safety and efficacy of allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation using a peripheral blood stem cell graft that has been depleted of CD45RA+
      Naive T-cells.

      The secondary objectives will be to measure the pace of immune recovery.
     
      A cohort of patients (Cohort 1) will be enrolled to receive the currently accepted standard
      approach to myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation. With the exception of volume
      and/or plasma depletion (in cases of donor/recipient ABO incompatibility), the peripheral
      blood stem cell graft will be unmodified. The primary purpose of Cohort 1 is to prospectively
      collect samples for measurement of immune recovery from a relatively homogeneous population
      of patients treated in a uniform manner. Within the limitations of age-matching, patients
      accrued to Cohort 1 will be incorporated into a larger retrospective historical control group
      for purposes of comparison with Cohort 2 of the incidence of grade II-IV acute Graft versus
      Host disease. The experimental aspects of this trial will be the use of a naïve T-cell
      depleted peripheral blood stem cell graft (Cohort 2). All other aspects of this stem cell
      transplantation are in line with the standard of care. Recruitment to this trial will be
      stratified by donor type as matched sibling or matched unrelated donor. Patients will be
      conditioned with total body irradiation (1350cGy) and Cyclophosphamide. The donor stem cell
      grafts will come from mobilized peripheral blood of 6/6 HLA-identical family members or 8/8

      all consecutive patients with a symptomatic ST of the lower limbs at least 5 cm long
      documented by compression ultrasonography. Follow-up was three months. All events were
      adjudicated by a central committee.
     
      Between March 2005 and October 2006, 844 patients (median age [range]: 65 [18-98] years; 547

      A variety of studies demonstrate that ocular blood flow is altered in glaucoma. Various
      animal and human studies have shown an increase in retinal and optic nerve head blood flow in
      response to diffuse luminance flicker. Based on studies with ERG, this effect has been
      attributed to augmented activity in the retinal ganglion cells and associated axons
      indicating a coupling mechanism between neuronal activity and retinal blood flow. Whereas a
      variety of studies have confirmed these effects, the knowledge about this coupling in the
      retina of patients with glaucoma is sparse.

      Recently the investigators could show that flicker induced vasodilatation is blunted in
      patients with open angle glaucoma. However, the investigators results are limited by the fact
      that only data about retinal vessel diameters, not blood flow per se, are available. The
      further development of the investigators current flicker stimulation technique now allows us
      to determine blood flow velocity during flicker stimulation. Thus, in the current study, the
      investigators set out to determine whether this blood flow response is impaired in patients
      with glaucoma as compared to those in healthy volunteers and whether this is related to
      altered neural activity.

      The study objective was, to investigate whether the blood flow response to flicker
      stimulation is altered in patients with glaucoma.

      RATIONALE: Studying a diagnostic biomarker test in blood samples from patients who have
      undergone a donor stem cell transplant for cancer may help doctors plan treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying an immunologic diagnostic blood test to see how well
      it works in predicting side-effects in patients with hematologic cancer or other disorders
      who have undergone a donor stem cell transplant.
     
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To evaluate the ability of the ImmuKnow® test to predict the onset and severity of acute
           or chronic graft-versus-host disease and/or measure the clinical effects of treatment.

        -  To evaluate the ability of the ImmuKnow test to predict the clinical response to
           immunosuppressive therapy.

        -  To evaluate the ability of the ImmuKnow test to predict infections among patients.

      OUTLINE: Beginning on day 14 after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT),
      patients undergo blood sample collection at least once weekly for the first 100 days and then
      once to twice monthly for up to 1 year, in the absence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).
      If chronic or acute GVHD develops after day 100, more frequent blood sampling may occur.
      Blood sample collection is coordinated with the time of regular clinic visits to allow for
      evaluation of the clinical events recorded 2 weeks before and after the blood draw date.
      Blood samples are analyzed by the Cylex® and ImmuKnow® assays to measure global T-cell immune
      function and responsiveness to alterations in immunosuppressive post-HSCT therapy. Assay data
      obtained during the first 3 weeks and other post-transplant periods will be evaluated for
      possible correlations with clinical endpoints (i.e., GVHD incidence, rate of infection, and
      response to immunosuppressive therapy) to assess the predictive value of the assay.

           distance and to compare the average change between treatment groups.
     
      Kyphoplasty and Vertebroplasty:

      Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty are types of surgery that are used to treat broken bones in
      the back, which may have been caused by cancer. Both procedures involve injecting a mixture
      of medical cement into the broken bone(s) in the back. The cement is designed to harden and
      become a permanent part of the bone, supporting the bone like an ""internal cast"" that brings
      it back to its original shape. The amount of cement will vary from person to person, but it
      could be, for example, anywhere from a fraction of a teaspoon to a full teaspoon.

      The main difference between the 2 procedures is that kyphoplasty involves the use of a small
      medical type of balloon, and vertebroplasty does not use balloons. Vertebroplasty also uses a
      slightly smaller needle to inject the cement.

      The Study Device:

      The Cavity SpineWand is a rod-shaped surgical tool that is designed to use a type of energy
      called plasma in order to destroy tissue at lower temperatures than other surgical methods.
      This may help to lessen damage to other nearby tissue.

      In this study, the Cavity SpineWand will be used to remove tissue (soft tissue, bone tissue,
      or both, but this will vary from person to person), including all or part of the cancerous
      tumors in the area of the broken bone(s). This is designed to make extra room for the cement
      to be injected, either during the vertebroplasty procedure or the kyphoplasty procedure.

      Screening Tests:

      Before you can receive treatment in this study, you will have ""screening tests"" to help the
      doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this study. If you have had some of these
      tests done recently, they may not need to be repeated. This will be up to your study doctor.
      The following tests may be performed:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded.

        -  You will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and a computed tomography (CT)
           scan. These scans will show pictures of your broken back bone(s) and the tumor. Your
           doctor will use these pictures to plan your surgery.

      Women who are able to have children must have a negative urine pregnancy test.

      Doctors currently do not fully understand whether kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty is better for
      treating broken bones in the back. For this reason, and because this study involves randomly
      assigning participants to receive one or the other of these procedures, all participants must
      be eligible for both procedures in order to take part in this study.

      Treatment Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in the study, you will be assigned to a
      treatment group. In each phase of the study, there is an equal chance of being assigned to
      any of the treatment groups.

      If you are one of the first 20 patients enrolled in the study, you will be enrolled in Phase
      1. You will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. Phase 1 Group 1
      will receive vertebroplasty, and Phase 1 Group 2 will receive kyphoplasty.

      If you are one of the next 60 patients to be enrolled, you will be enrolled in Phase 2. You
      will be randomly assigned (as in the toss of dice) to 1 of 4 groups. Phase 2 Group 1 will
      receive vertebroplasty, and Phase 2 Group 2 will receive vertebroplasty with the Cavity
      SpineWand. Phase 2 Group 3 will receive kyphoplasty, and Phase 2 Group 4 will receive
      kyphoplasty with the Cavity SpineWand.

      Study Tests/Procedures Before Surgery:

      Within about 2-4 weeks before surgery, you will have tests and procedures performed. If you
      had some of these tests done recently, they may not need to be repeated. The following
      procedures may be performed:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs (blood pressure,
           heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate).

        -  You will complete questionnaires that ask about the back pain and any drugs you are
           taking. In total, the questionnaires should take about 10-20 minutes to complete.

        -  You will be asked to walk 50 feet at your own pace while being timed to see how long it
           takes you. This is a routine test for comparing your walking function before and after
           surgery.

      You will sign a separate consent form for surgery and the drugs used during surgery. These
      drugs include antibiotics to help lower the risk of infection, drugs to control pain, local
      anesthesia to make the area of your back where you are having surgery feel numb, and a
      sedative to make you feel relaxed and sleepy. The risks of these drugs will be explained to
      you in detail at that time.

      Blood Test on the Day of Surgery:

      On the day of surgery, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn. This blood will be compared
      with the blood that is drawn after surgery, to see when after surgery the most tumor cells
      are found in the blood.

      Other Procedures Before Surgery:

      As is standard for these types of surgery, special ""bone"" needles will be placed into the
      broken bone(s) in your back. X-rays will be used to guide the needles into a safe position. A
      biopsy of the tumor in your back bone will be collected to check the diagnosis of cancer. To
      collect a biopsy, a small amount of tumor tissue is withdrawn through the bone needle.

      Surgical Procedures:

      If you are in Phase 2 Group 2 or Phase 2 Group 4, the Cavity SpineWand will be used to remove
      a small amount of tissue immediately before the kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty procedure.

      If you are in Phase 1 Group 2, Phase 2 Group 3, or Phase 2 Group 4, the kyphoplasty procedure
      will be done next. A small balloon will be placed into the area in your back where the tumor
      is located. Fluid will then be pumped through the tube in order to fill the balloon, which
      will create a hole in the back bone. After the balloon is deflated (closed) and removed, this
      hole will then be filled with cement. X-rays will be used to help place the cement safely.

      If you are in Phase 1 Group 1, Phase 2 Group 1, or Phase 2 Group 2, the vertebroplasty
      procedure will be done next (instead of the kyphoplasty). Cement will be injected into the
      back bone. X-rays will be used to help place the cement safely.

      No matter which treatment group you are in, if you have more than 1 broken back bone that
      needs treatment, the procedures described above will be repeated for a second broken bone,
      right after your first procedure. In other words, if you had vertebroplasty performed without
      the Cavity Spine Wand, that same procedure would be performed for the second bone. The
      procedure would only be repeated this 1 additional time, and not a third time.

      No matter which treatment you receive, the entire procedure should take about 2-3 hours. If
      you need to have the procedure repeated on a second broken bone, this additional procedure
      should add about 45 minutes to the 2-3 hours that the first procedure alone would have taken.

      Blood Testing for Phase 1 Participants:

      Phase 1 participants will have blood (about 1 tablespoon each time) drawn at 8 different
      times points in order to measure the number of tumor cells. This blood will be drawn at 10,
      30, and 60 minutes, and then at 2 hours, and between 6-8 hours, 10-18 hours, 20-28 hours, and
      7 days after the surgery.

      Blood Testing for Phase 2 Participants:

      Phase 2 participants will have blood (about 1 tablespoon each time) drawn at 4 different time
      points after surgery. The first and second blood draw will occur before 36 hours has passed.
      The third blood draw will be about 36 hours after the surgery, and the fourth blood draw will
      be about 7 days after the surgery. This blood will be tested to measure the number of tumor
      cells.

      Follow-Up Care:

      You will be asked to return for follow-up visits at 7 days after your surgery and again at 4
      weeks after your surgery. At these visits, the following tests and procedures will be
      performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs.

        -  You will complete the questionnaires that ask about the back pain and any drugs you are
           taking.

        -  You will be asked to walk a 50-foot distance, and your walk will be timed.

        -  At the Day 7 visit only, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn to measure the number
           of tumor cells.

        -  At the Week 4 visit only, you will be asked to complete a questionnaire that asks you to
           rate how satisfied you feel with the surgery. It should take about 10 minutes to
           complete.

      At 3 months after your surgery, the study staff will call you at home to ask about the back
      pain and any drugs you may be taking.

      Length of Study Participation:

      After the Month 3 follow-up phone call, your active participation in this study will be over.
      If it is determined after your surgery that the tumor in your back was not cancerous, you
      would still return for the follow-up visits as is standard, but you would not need to have
      the Day 7 blood test to measure the number of tumor cells.

      This is an investigational study. The vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty procedures are
      commercially available and FDA approved for the way they are being used in this study. The
      Cavity SpineWand is also commercially available and FDA approved for the way it is being used
      in this study. The research-specific part of this study is the blood testing to measure any
      increases in the number of cancer cells in the blood.

      Up to 100 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
     Cancer :

          1. Patient is >18 years old.

          2. Patient is a candidate for standard vertebroplasty or Kyphoplasty with reasonable
             safety, as determined by the physician performing the procedure.

          3. Patient is medically fit to undergo conscious sedation.

          4. Patient is able to understand and give consent to participation in the study.

          5. Patient presents with back pain >= 50 (on a 0-100 VAS scale).

          6. Patient presents with a vertebral compression fracture believed to be due to
             malignancy.

          7. Patient agrees to undergo, prior to the procedure, both magnetic resonance imaging
             (MRI, within 45 days of the planned procedure) and computed tomography (CT, within 14
             days of the procedure). If MRI is contraindicated (due to pacemakers, intracranial
             ferromagnetic metal, etc), imaging with a nuclear medicine bone scan could be used as
             an alternative. CT remains mandated as a planning modality for all cases.

          8. Patient has a life expectancy of at least 4 months.

          9. Patient agrees to participate in the clinical study and to complete all required
             visits and evaluations.

         10. Patient's vertebrae can safely be accessed with an 8 Gauge Cannula.

         11. Suitable test for Circulating Tumor Cell Burden (CTCB) is available.

         :

          1. Patient has unfavorable surgical anatomy to indicate that the patient could not be
             safely treated in any one of the four surgical groups if the patient was randomized to
             that group.

          2. Patient has uncorrectable coagulopathy.

          3. The metastatic lesions are determined to be blastic in nature and contain such
             sclerotic bone that the fracture site cannot adequately be accessed.

          4. Vertebral compression fractures are present at multiple-levels and more than 2 levels
             must be treated during the same surgery (patients who have multi-level disease can
             still be enrolled provided no more than 2 levels be treated at one occasion).

          5. Patient has significant risk of procedure-related complications due to potential
             interactions with devices or materials used in the procedures, i.e., Pacemaker implant
             or Allergy (e.g., to cement, cannula metal, contrast medium, etc.)

          6. Patient is unable to provide informed consent.

      FOLFOX4 plus Avastin has been suggested as firstline regimen for advanced colorectal cancer
      by NCCN, a new angiogenesis inhibitor, known as Endostar(Recombinant Human Endostatin),
      prolonged the overall survival, time to progression and improved response rate in metastatic
      lung cancer in a large phase III clinical trial in china, so we design this trial to evaluate
      the safty and efficacy of FolFox4 plus Endostar in patients with advanced colorectal cancer
     
      Endostar is free supported by Shangdong Simcere Medgene biotech co.,Ltd. Endostar combination
      with Chemotherapy has been the first line treatment regimen to advanced NSCLC. Clinical data
      proved that Endostar was a wild spectrum and safe antiangiogenesis factor which could
      suppress almost 65 kinds of tumor mass in animal models and affect about 12 percent human
      genome. China NCCN colon or rectal cancer clinical practice guideline recommends Chemotherapy
      plus angiogenesis inhibitor as the first line treatment scheme. So we design FOLFOX4 plus
      Endostar to treat advanced colorectal cancer to research the RR and safety. We believe this
      treatment regimen may be a new approach to the advanced colorectal cancer patients.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if the study drug (antimalarial medication) is safe
      when given to healthy subjects as a single dose or as repeated doses, to understand the
      effect of food on single doses of study drug and to determine if the study drug has an effect
      on other approved medications such as rosiglitazone and rosuvastatin.
     
      Malaria is a type of parasitic infection, common in tropical and subtropical regions of the
      world, including parts of the Americas, Asia, and Africa. In recent years there has been a
      rapid spread of drug resistant malaria which makes it necessary to develop new antimalarial
      treatments. In animal studies, GSK932121 is shown to be able to kill the malaria parasite and
      is fully active against drug resistant malaria parasites. It is hoped that information
      collected on this study will lead to an improved treatment for malaria.

      This is a first time in human fusion study which has 3 parts:

      Part A - single dose escalation/ food effect: a study where the study drug is given once
      only- first at the lowest dose of in a group of participants and the dose increased only if
      the previous dose is found to be safe. It also looks at the effect of food on the study drug
      in the body Part B - repeat dose escalation: a study where the study drug will be given daily
      for up to 7 days - first at a lower dose in a group of participants and the dose increased
      for the next group only if the previous dose is found to be safe and Part B - drug-drug
      interaction: a study where the study drug will be given daily for up to 7 days at a dose
      determined to be safe in previous groups of participants and looking at the effect of the
      study drug on other specific approved medications (such as rosiglitazone--a diabetic
      medication and rosuvastatin--a cholesterol lowering medication) in the body.

      Safety will be assessed by measurement of vital signs, cardiac monitoring, spirometry,
      collection of adverse event assessments, renal biomarkers and laboratory safety tests.

      The objective of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of masitinib (AB1010) to
      placebo in patients with mastocytosis with handicap.
     
      This was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 3
      study, conducted in 15 countries, evaluating the efficacy and safety of masitinib (6
      mg/kg/day administered orally in two daily intakes over 24-weeks with a double-blind
      extension period possible) for the treatment of indolent systemic mastocytosis, smoldering
      mastocytosis or cutaneous mastocytosis, in patients with mast cells mediator release symptoms
      that are refractory to conventional symptomatic treatment.

      A study protocol amendment restricted enrolment to patients with severe indolent and
      smoldering systemic mastocytosis. The objective of this phase 3 study was therefore to
      evaluate masitinib efficacy and safety in severe systemic mastocytosis patients, with or
      without D816V mutation of c-Kit. The primary objective of the phase 3 study was to detect a
      statistically significant difference between masitinib (plus optimal concomitant symptomatic
      treatments) and placebo (plus optimal concomitant symptomatic treatments) in cumulative
      response on four severe symptoms, referred to also as handicaps.
