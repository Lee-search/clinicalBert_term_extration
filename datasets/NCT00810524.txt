Influence of Antiviral Treatment to the Long-Term Prognosis of Patients With Chronic HBV Infection 
      Influence of antiviral treatment to the long term prognosis of patients with chronic HBV
      infection. The aim of antiviral treatment for HBV is to reduce the long term severe
      complications. In this study, the investigators divided patients with chronic HBV infection
      into two groups, which start early antiviral treatment and conventional antiviral treatment
      respectively. All the patients will be followed for ten years. From this study, the
      investigators want to find out the optimal time for patients with chronic HBV infection to
      start antiviral treatment.
