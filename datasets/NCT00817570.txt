Evaluation of Balance Reactions of Transfemoral Amputees Using the Virtual Analysis System 
      The purpose of this study is to test and compare the balance reactions of Tranfemoral
      Amputees and able bodied subjects in response to perturbations given by a highly advanced
      Virtual Reality system.
     Balance :

          -  Transfemoral Amputees, walking without any assistive device, at least one year.

         :

          -  Amputees who suffer from a Neurological Injury/ disease that has implication on
             balance control.

          -  Amputees who suffer from Orthopedic Injury that has implication on balance control.

          -  Amputees who suffer from Cardiology disease that has implication on balance reactions.
