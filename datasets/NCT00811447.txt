Taxotere New Indication - Gastric Cancer Treatment Registration Trial 
      Primary objective:

      To detect a statistically significant increase in time to progression (TTP) of disease for
      the test group (Taxotere® [Docetaxel] combined with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil [TCF])
      relative to the control group (Cisplatin combined with 5-fluorouracil[CF])

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To detect a statistically significant increase in overall survival (OS) for the test
           group relative to the control group.

        -  To compare response rate (RR), time to treatment failure (TTF), duration of responses,
           safety profiles, quality of life (QOL), and disease-related symptoms.
     Stomach Neoplasms :

          -  Gastric adenocarcinoma including adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction,
             histologically proven.

          -  Measurable and/or evaluable metastatic disease; if a single metastatic lesion is the
             only manifestation of the disease, cytology or histology is mandatory. Locally
             recurrent disease is accepted provided that there is at least one measurable lesion.

          -  Performance status Karnofsky index >70%

          -  Life expectancy of more than 3 months

          -  Adequate haematological parameters (Hb≥9g/dl, ANC≥2.0× 109/L, platelets ≥ 100× 109/L)

          -  Creatinine ≤ 1.25 UNL, serum magnesium should be within the normal value

          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1 UNL, AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 UNL, alkaline phosphatase ≤ 5 UNL

          -  No prior palliative chemotherapy, previous adjuvant chemotherapy is allowed if more
             than 12 months has elapsed between the end of adjuvant therapy and first relapse.

          -  At least 6 weeks from prior radiotherapy and 3 weeks from surgery

          -  Complete initial work-up within two weeks prior to first infusion for clinical
             evaluation and biological work-up. Abdominal CT scan and chest X-rays are mandatory.

          -  Patients with reproductive potential not implementing adequate contraceptive measures

          -  Other tumor type than adenocarcinoma

          -  Any prior palliative chemotherapy. Prior adjuvant chemotherapy with a first relapse
             within 12 months from the end of adjuvant

          -  Prior treatment with taxanes. Prior CDDP as adjuvant chemotherapy with cumulative dose
             > 300mg/m²

          -  Previous or current malignancies other than gastric carcinoma, with the exception of
             adequately treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri or non melanoma skin cancer

          -  Patients with known brain or leptomeningeal metastases

          -  Symptomatic peripheral neuropathy ≥ grade 2 by NCIC-CTG criteria

          -  Other serious illness or medical conditions:

               -  unstable cardiac disease despite treatment, myocardial infarction within 6 months
                  prior to study entry

                  seizures

               -  active uncontrolled infection

               -  active disseminated intravascular coagulation

               -  other serious underlying medical conditions which could impair the ability of the
                  patient to participate in the study

          -  Concurrent treatment with corticosteroids except as use for the prophylactic
             medication regimen, treatment of acute hypersensitivity reactions or unless chronic
             treatment at low doses

          -  Definite contraindications for the use of corticosteroids

          -  Hypercalcemia not controlled by bisphosphonates and more than 12mg/100ml
