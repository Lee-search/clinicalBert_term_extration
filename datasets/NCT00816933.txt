Trial on Postoperative Outcomes According to the Number of Trocar During Laparoscopic Appendectomy 
      Appendicitis is the most common benign inflammatory disease that requires an operation.

      Laparoscopic appendectomy using three trocar is generally performed, and reveals good
      surgical outcomes incluing less pain, early recovey, cosmetic effect et al. However, with
      using three trocar, there are some problems including pain around trocar insertion
      sites(three portions), wound infecton and scar at trocar insertion sites. For these reasons,
      more minimal invasive appendectomy is required, with development of laparoscopic
      instrument,eventually one port sppectomy is developed. So, the investigators assess
      post-operative Outcomes according to the Number of Trocar.
     Appendicitis :

          -  Appendicitis (clinical or radilogical diagnosis)

          -  ASA < 4

         :

          -  Appendicitis with palpable mass( clinical or radilogical diagnosis)

          -  Patient has bleeding tendency

          -  Pregnant
