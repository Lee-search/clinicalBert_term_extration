COMbination of Clopidogrel and Aspirin for Prevention of Early REcurrence in Acute Atherothrombotic Stroke 
      Primary objective:

        -  Comparison of efficacy of the combination therapy (clopidogrel plus aspirin) and the
           aspirin alone (main comparison) to prevent any recurrent ischemic lesion .

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Comparison of Modified Rankin scale (mRS) scores;

        -  Comparison of the Incidence of all kinds of stroke and vascular death;

        -  Comparison of the Incidence of bleeding episodes (major and minor) and symptomatic
           intracerebral hemorrhages during the follow-up period.
     Stroke :

          -  Ischemic stroke diagnosed within 48 hours from symptom onset;

          -  Cerebral ischemic lesion observed on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
             (DWI MRI);

          -  Relevant atherothrombotic lesions on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computed
             tomography angiography (CTA);

          -  Study drug administration within 48 hours from symptom onset;

          -  mRS score is 0-2 before the stroke.

         :

          -  Evidences of other relevant brain lesions such as Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or
             brain tumor;

          -  Suspicious of stroke due to small-vessel occlusion;

          -  Stroke due to cardioembolism;

          -  Clinical necessity of conventional angiography or intervention before the end of
             study;

          -  Past history of ICH;

          -  Bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy;

          -  Chronic anemia (Hb<8.0) or thrombocytopenia (PLT<100K);

          -  Chronic liver disease (AST> 100 or ALT>100);

          -  Any other clinically relevant serious disease, including renal failure ( creatinine
             clearance<30mL/min);

          -  Allergy to Aspirin or clopidogrel;

          -  Subjected to intervention or surgical treatments within 3 months;

          -  Thrombolysis performed with rt-PA or UK after the stroke;

          -  Participation in another clinical study within the previous 30 days;

          -  Suspicious of poor drug compliance and requirements of the protocol;

          -  Females who are pregnant, breast-feeding, or childbearing potential and not using
             medically acceptable and effective contraception.
