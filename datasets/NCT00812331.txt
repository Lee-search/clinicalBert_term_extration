A Study to Assess the Anti-viral Activity, Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of TMC435350 in Participants Infected With Hepatitis C-Virus (HCV) 
      The purpose of this study is to assess anti-viral activity (inhibition of viral growth) of
      TMC435350 in genotype 2,3,4,5 and 6 hepatitis C virus infected participants who have never
      received treatment for their hepatitis C infection.
     
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention) study to assess the
      antiviral activity, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (explores what the body does to
      the medication) of TMC435350 hereafter referred to as TMC435. Approximately 40 participants
      will be divided in 5 groups as per the genotype (8 participants each group). The study will
      include a screening phase (up to 6 weeks), treatment phase (7 days) and a follow-up phase
      (30-35 days after the last dose of study medication). Safety evaluations will include
      assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests and cardiovascular safety.
     Hepatitis C :

          -  Participants with documented chronic genotype 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 hepatitis C virus (HCV)
             infection

          -  Participants who have never received treatment for their HCV infection

          -  Participants with either no cirrhosis or up to Child Pugh A liver disease

          -  Participants with plasma HCV genotype level of more than or equal to 100, 000 IU/mL at
             screening

         :

          -  Evidence of Child Pugh B or C liver disease at screening, decompensated liver disease
             defined as prior or current history of ascities, hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal or
             gastric varices

          -  Participants with diagnosed or suspected hepatocellular carcinoma

          -  Participants coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 or 2, or hepatitis A
             or B virus infection or active tuberculosis at screening

          -  Participants with any active clinically significant disease, or medical history or
             physical examination or electrocardiogram findings during screening
