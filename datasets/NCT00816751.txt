Paracervical Versus Intracervical Lidocaine 
      The aim of this study is to estimate the efficacy of intracervical versus paracervical block
      on pain experienced during first trimester suction curettage without the use of preoperative
      cervical ripening. Because of the theoretical improved reliability of stromal block, the
      investigators hypothesize that intracervical block would produce lower pain scores than
      paracervical block at the time of cervical dilation.
