Study to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Micafungin Versus Conventional Amphotericin B for the Treatment of Neonatal Candidiasis 
      The study will evaluate how effective and how safe the drug micafungin is when compared to
      the drug amphotericin B deoxycholate in treating neonates and young infants with certain
      fungal infections.
     
      Neonates and young infants will be stratified by estimated gestational age and by world
      region
     Candidiasis :

          -  Infant greater than 48 hours of life after birth up to day of life 120 at the time of
             culture acquisition

          -  Diagnosis of proven invasive candidiasis within 4 days prior to study start

          -  Subject's parent or legal guardian agrees not to allow subject to participate in
             another study with another investigational drug while on treatment.

         :

          -  Infant with any history of a hypersensitivity or severe vasomotor reaction to any
             echinocandin or systemic amphotericin B product

          -  Infant who has received more than 48 hours of systemic antifungal therapy prior to the
             first dose of study drug

          -  Infant who has a breakthrough systemic fungal infection while receiving amphotericin B
             product or an echinocandin as prophylaxis

          -  Infant who has failed prior systemic antifungal therapy for this episode of invasive
             candidiasis

          -  Infant who is co-infected with a non-Candida fungal organism

          -  Infant whose positive yeast cultures are solely from an indwelling bladder catheter
             (unless obtained at the time the indwelling catheter was placed) or sputum.

          -  Infant previously enrolled in this study
