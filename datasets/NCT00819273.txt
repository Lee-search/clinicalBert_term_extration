Investigation Into the Correlation of Plasma Hs-CRP Concentrations and Cardiovascular Risk in Korean Population 
      An observational, non-interventional, multi-centre study to provide further information on
      the utility of test for a predictive marker by investigating the current prevalence of high
      sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) testing and characteristics of each CVD risk group.
     hsCRP :

          -  Subjects with at least one clinic visit record within the last 12 months from the date
             of data entry.

          -  Subjects with at least one hs-CRP level measured within the last 12 months from the
             date of data entry.

         :

          -  Use of statins or other lipid-lowering therapies including fibrates, niacin, and bile
             acid sequestrants in the past 3 months prior to hsCRP measurement

          -  Active inflammatory diseases documented during the period of CRP measurement

          -  Subjects taking immunosuppressants

          -  Findings of chronic inflammation: arthritis, lupus, or inflammatory bowel disease
