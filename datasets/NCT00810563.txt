Does Bupivacaine in Laparoscopic Portals Reduce Post Surgery Pain in Tubal Ligation by Electrocoagulation? 
      The use of bupivacaine , an anesthesic, in laparoscopic portals is recommended in some
      surgeries. In the ase of tubal ligation by electrocoagulation, where pain is reduced, there
      is no evidence of this benefit. The objective of this study is to verify the degree of pain
      after laparoscopic tubal ligation surgery in patient who received bupivacaine 0.5% in the
      portal, or placebo
     
      In order to conduct this study, the internal and external validation were considered.

      The author will use different gynecological teams, with different expertise to perform the
      laparoscopic tubal ligation, but using the same surgical and anesthesic technique. Second
      year residents, during their rotation, and medical staff will perform the surgery.

      Anesthesic technique:

      Intravenous remifentanil 0.1-0.5 micrograms/kg/min Intravenous Propofol target controlled or
      sevoflurane Intermittent ventilation using O2 40 - 100%, with or without compressed air.
      Before incision: 5mL of bupivacaine 0.5% or saline solution 0.9% from the aponeurosis until
      the skin In the end of the procedure: intravenous 4mg of dexamethasone + 40mg of tenoxican

      Post-operation prescription:

      NPO util well awake, then free according to patientÂ´s tolerance If nausea/vomit:
      metoclopramide 10mg IV If pain: dipyrone 1g IV qid If pain is intense: morphine 3mg IV 3/3 h
      If pain persists: morphine 1mg h/h

      After hospital discharge:

      If pain: sodium diclofenac 50mg tid
     Pain :

          -  All patients schedule for laparoscopic tubal ligation

         :

          -  Not willing to consent

          -  Use of analgesic within 12 hours prior the surgery

          -  Known allergy or contraindications to bupivacaine, dipyrone, porphine, or sodium
             diclofenac
