Trial Comparing Outcomes With Merocel Packing or Thrombin-JMI for Anterior Epistaxis 
      Epistaxis is a common problem among people of all ages and backgrounds. However, occasionally
      epistaxis can be severe enough to require emergency room admission. Among the treatment
      options for epistaxis, nasal packing is the most common approach. This approach requires a
      return visit to the clinic for removal of the packing. Additionally, there is a great deal of
      pain during the insertion and removal of this packing. This study aims to justify the further
      investigation of thrombin as a potential treatment approach for these patients. Thrombin
      could provide a treatment approach that reduces pain and eliminates the need for a return
      visit to the clinic.
