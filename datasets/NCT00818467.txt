UVB Light and Sunscreen 
      Patients need vitamin D which is normally produced in the skin in response to ultraviolet
      light from the sun. Vitamin D is important for calcium absorption and good bone health.
      Physicians have been using sunscreens to protect patients from skin cancer and the aging
      effects of sunlight for a least a half a century. Dermatologists have promoted sunscreen use
      to restrict sunlight exposure especially in white Caucasians. If this behavior is done 100%
      of the time when outdoors individuals may suffer from vitamin D deficiency. It is impossible
      to influence persons' behavior to wear sunscreens all the time when outdoors. With the use of
      sunless tanning agent (DHA), once a week, we can obtain a continuous sunscreen in the top
      layer of the skin that will not wash off, can't be removed with soap and water, or removed by
      perspiration. Under these circumstances we can answer the scientific question, will sunscreen
      use inhibit the production of vitamin D in the skin?
