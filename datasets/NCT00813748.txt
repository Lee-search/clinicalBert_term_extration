Pharmacosurveillance Data Repository of Patients With and Without History of Anaphylactic Reactions Subsequent to Xolair Dosing 
      This study will establish a clinical data and serum repository of anaphylaxis cases
      associated with Xolair administration and control patients who have received Xolair without
      associated anaphylaxis. This is an observational repository and not an investigational
      clinical trial. Associated with the repository is an optional skin testing substudy.
