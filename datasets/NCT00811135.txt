A Study of Avastin (Bevacizumab) in Combination With Herceptin (Trastuzumab) and Xeloda (Capecitabine) in Patients With HER2-Positive Breast Cancer 
      This single arm study will assess the efficacy and safety of Avastin in combination with
      Herceptin and Xeloda as first-line treatment of patients with HER2-positive locally recurrent
      or metastatic breast cancer. Patients will receive 3-weekly treatment cycles of Herceptin
      (8mg/kg iv on day 1 of first cycle, followed by 6mg/kg iv maintenance dose on day 1 of
      subsequent cycles), Xeloda (1000mg/m2 bid po on days 1-14 of each treatment cycle) and
      Avastin (15mg/kg on day 2 of first treatment cycle,and on day 1 of each subsequent cycle).The
      anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression, and the target sample size
      is <100 individuals.
