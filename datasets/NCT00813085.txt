A Randomized Trial of Electronic Integration of Care for Better Diabetes Outcomes; The COMPETE II Study 
      This study will evaluate whether the use of an electronic diabetes tracker by both patients
      and family physicians in Ontario improves diabetes outcomes, satisfaction with care and with
      technology and health data privacy issues. As part of the study, the investigators will be
      able to test whether practices that use computers perform any better than practices using
      paper. The investigators also will be developing the first Canadian computerized chart
      summary for each patient that can be communicated securely in emergencies (the Emergency
      Health Record) and read by all current electronic systems.
