Intra-observer and Inter-observer Variability With Dynamic Contour Tonometry. 
      The aim of the protocol is to document intra-observer and inter-observer variability with
      dynamic contour tonometry, and will also test the theory that pulse amplitude, as measured by
      dynamic contour tonometry, is correlated with the difference in systolic and diastolic blood
      pressures.
     Intraocular Pressure :

          -  Normal, healthy eyes

          -  Minimal to moderate refractive error

          -  Willingness to participate in the study

         :

          -  Diagnosis of any type of glaucoma

          -  Any prior ocular surgery

          -  Any prior ocular trauma

          -  Any known anterior segment pathology
