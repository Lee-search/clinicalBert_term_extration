Development of Pharmacogenomic Method to Predict Antidepressant Responsiveness 
      The Purpose of this study is to predict antidepressant response in advance using
      pharmacogenomics and peripheral biological markers in depressed patients.
     
      The difficulties to treat depressed patients are 1)the patients don't respond to
      antidepressant is about 40% of which, and 2) The time lag is existed until the patients
      respond to antidepressant and show the treatment effects.

      If it is predicted the response of antidepressant in advance, it would be overcome such
      problems. Drug response generally is known to be related to the individual genetic
      information and the environmental factors. We are going to investigation about antidepressant
      response using these approaches.
     Depression :

          1. 25 < age <85

          2. major depressed patients satisfied with the diagnosis criteria depression of DSM-IV

          3. interview with one more patient's family member for objective diagnosis and final
             diagnosis decision by agreements of two more psychiatric physicians

         :

          1. received psychotropic medication within 2 weeks of the study or fluoxetine within 4
             weeks

          2. potential study participants for pregnancy, significant medical conditions, abnormal
             laboratory baseline values, unstable psychiatric features(eg.suicidal), history of
             alcohol of drug dependence, seizures, head trauma with loss of consciousness,
             neurological illness, or concomitant Axis I psychiatric disorder.
