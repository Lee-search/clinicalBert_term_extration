A Phase II Trial of Ofatumumab in Subjects With Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia 
      Given the tolerability and efficacy of ofatumumab in follicular lymphoma and Chronic
      Lymphocytic Leukemia, and the need to improve therapy for patients with WM utilizing a
      non-myelosuppressive agent this phase II trial of ofatumumab is being initiated in patients
      with Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (WM).
