Efficacy and Safety of a Retinoid in the Treatment of Severe Chronic Hand Eczema 
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of alitretinoin in the
      treatment of severe chronic hand eczema that does not respond to treatment with potent
      topical steroids.
     
      Chronic hand eczema (CHE)is a distressing disease that poses difficult problems for
      dermatologists. CHE leads to considerable work-absenteeism, disability and exclusion from
      labour market. Conventional treatments, including highly potent topical steroids, yield often
      unsatisfactory results. This study investigates the efficacy and safety of oral alitretinoin,
      a retinoid, in patients who have not responded to avoidance of causative factors, such as
      contact allergens and skin irritants, non-medicated skin care and highly potent topical
      steroids. Eligible patients are randomly assigned to receive alitretinoin or a placebo.

             avoid the substances
