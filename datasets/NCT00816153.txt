Pleth Variability Index and Fluid Management During Surgery 
      Pleth Variability Index (PVI) seems to be an ideal parameter to guide fluid management:
      dynamic parameter and non-invasive. PVI could guide fluid management during surgery and
      optimization of the plethysmographic-derived parameter could improve hemodynamics of the
      patients.
     Fluid Management :

          -  Major abdominal surgery

         :

          -  Refusal or inability to understand the protocol

          -  Arrythmia

          -  <18 years

          -  Contraindication to normal mechanical ventilation
