Aspirin Responsiveness in Women at Risk for Cardiac Events 
      The objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the prevalence of biological aspirin
      resistance in women at risk for CHD taking low dose (81 mg) aspirin. Aspirin responsiveness
      will be measured with the VerifyNow device (Accumetrics; San Diego, CA). Those women
      identified as biologically resistant will be switched to aspirin 325 mg for 14 days and then
      re-tested for aspirin responsiveness.
