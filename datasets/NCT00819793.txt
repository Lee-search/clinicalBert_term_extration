CentriMag Ventricular Assist System in Treating Failure-to-Wean From Cardiopulmonary Bypass 
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the CentriMag
      ventricular assist system to help patients who have experienced heart failure during surgery
      and cannot be removed from cardiac bypass.
     Heart Failure :

          -  At least 18 years of age

          -  Cardiac dysfunction due to failure-to-wean from cardiopulmonary bypass

          -  Subjects who are on IABP, CPB, ECMO or CPS support prior to evaluation should have the
             device turned off, if possible, for the purpose of measuring inclusion hemodynamics.
             However, these devices should not be turned off in patients who would be harmed by
             interruption of support.

          -  All subjects must meet the following criteria at the time of enrollment:

          -  Hemodynamics:

               1. cardiac index ≤ 2.2 L/min/m2

               2. For patients being evaluated for left-sided support (LVAD): PCWP ≥ 18 mmHg or
                  PADP ≥ 18 mmHg or LAP ≥ 18 mmHg

               3. For patients being evaluated for right or biventricular support: CVP ≥ 15 mmHg or
                  RAP ≥ 15 mmHg and RVSWI ≤ 4.1 gm/m2/beat

               4. Enrollment without hemodynamic measurements due to frequent or unpredictable
                  dysrhythmias, unacceptable cardiac function, or hemodynamic instability is
                  allowed.

          -  Placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump has been attempted unless contraindicated

          -  All possible measures have been attempted to correct low arterial pH, arterial blood
             gas abnormalities, electrolytes, hypovolemia, hypervolemia, inadequate cardiac rate,
             dysrhythmias and residual hypothermia

          -  Cardiac resuscitation using pharmacologic agents, and epicardial pacing (if
             appropriate and possible) has been attempted

          -  Written, signed, and dated informed consent

         :

          -  BUN > 100 mg/dl

          -  Creatinine > 5 mg/dl

          -  Presence of any investigational mechanical circulatory support device

          -  Known history of liver cirrhosis or portal hypertension

          -  Pulmonary infarction

          -  Stroke, TIA or history of either condition within the last six months and/or any
             confirmed, existing neurologic deficits

          -  Active systemic infection defined as positive blood cultures, core temperature >100.5
             degrees, white blood count > 12,500, and treatment with antimicrobials

          -  Participation in a clinical trial with any experimental treatment within 30 days prior
             to screening or previous participation in the present study

          -  Other serious disease(s) limiting life expectancy
