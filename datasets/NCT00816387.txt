Fallopian Tube Sperm Perfusion (FSP) Versus Intra-uterine Insemination (IUI) in Natural Cycle 
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of fallopian sperm perfusion (FSP) in
      comparison with standard intrauterine insemination (IUI) in natural cycle for couples with
      unexplained infertility or mild male factor.
     
      A number of randomised controlled trials have been published comparing the efficacy of FSP
      with standard IUI. A recent meta-analysis has suggested that in couples with unexplained
      infertility Fallopian tube sperm perfusion together with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation
      (COH) leads to increased pregnancy rates than IUI and COH. No study has been published
      comparing the two insemination techniques in natural cycle.
