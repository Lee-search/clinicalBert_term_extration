A Two-part Trial Assessing the Effects of 7Î±-methyl-19-nortestosterone (MENT) on Blood Pressure in Normal Men: an Open-label Pilot Study Followed by a Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study 
      This is a two-part trial assessing the effects of MENT on blood pressure. The first part of
      the trial is an open-label pilot study to verify the MENT gel formulation delivers
      appropriate drug levels. Upon confirming MENT serum levels are within the required range,
      clinical trial material will be produced and labeled. Consequently, the second part of the
      trial, the main study, will proceed approximately two months after the conclusion of the
      pilot study. The main study, is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
