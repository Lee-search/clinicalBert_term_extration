Safety and Efficacy Study of the PTMA Device to Reduce Mitral Valve Regurgitation in Patients With Heart Failure 
      Improvement in heart failure with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation using a
      percutaneously delivered implantable device residing in the coronary sinus
     
      Device under Test: The ViacorÂ® Percutaneous Transvenous Mitral Annuloplasty (PTMA) system
      comprises a sterile implantable cardiac device and associated custom accessories to assist
      implantation. The PTMA system is intended to treat functional mitral regurgitation (MR) in a
      heart failure patient by a less invasive method than surgical annuloplasty with greater
      relief of symptoms than medical management alone.

      Study Objective: Functional mitral regurgitation is associated with an adverse prognosis in
      the heart failure patient. The objective of this study is to evaluate whether PTMA is
      effective in reducing mitral regurgitation in heart failure patients and whether this
      reduction is associated with a moderation in the adverse progression of heart failure
      symptoms.

      Hypothesis under Test: Reduction of the severity of functional mitral regurgitation from
      baseline, as defined by a composite improvement of quantitative echocardiographic metrics,
      can be achieved safely with the PTMA device and will be associated with a measurable
      moderation of adverse progression of heart failure symptoms and a moderation of the
      deterioration of exercise capacity.
     Mitral Regurgitation :

          -  Patient has moderate functional MR: regurgitant orifice area >/= 0.20cm2 or
             regurgitant volume >/= 30 mL/beat or regurgitant fraction >/= 30%

          -  Symptomatic heart failure NYHA Class II to IV

          -  LV dysfunction (25% < LVEF < 50% by echocardiography) OR dilated mitral annulus > 30mm

         :

          -  MR of organic origin

          -  Severe mitral leaflet tethering

          -  History of MI or PCI within 60 days of study procedure

          -  Inability to walk a minimum of 100 meters in 6 minutes

          -  Significant left main stenosis or proximal circumflex stent

          -  Indication of non-patent CSO or discontinuous CS-GCV-AIV

          -  Bi-ventricular with leads in CS or other devices impeding device placement

          -  Severe aortic valvular disease

          -  Chronic corticosteroid use other than < 20mg prednisone for arthritis

          -  Significant co-morbidities
