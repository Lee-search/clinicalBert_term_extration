Evaluate Safety and Effectiveness of MBX-102 in Type 2 Diabetes Patients With Poor Glycemic Control on Metformin 
      To define the relative efficacy, safety and tolerability profiles of oral daily MBX-102 at
      daily doses of 400 and 600 mg vs. placebo and Actos® 30 mg (up-titrated to 45 mg after 8
      weeks) when administered for up to 24 weeks in patients inadequately controlled with a stable
      dose of metformin (≥ 1500 mg/day).
     
      Approximately 240 patients will be randomized in this study, 60 to each of two MBX-102
      treatment groups (400 and 600 mg daily), 60 to placebo, and 60 to the Actos® group. Patients
      in the Actos® group will receive Actos® 30 mg/daily for the first eight weeks of the
      treatment phase and Actos® 45 mg/daily for the last 16 weeks of the treatment phase. Patients
      in the MBX-102 400 mg group and MBX-102 600 mg group will continue MBX-102 400 mg and 600 mg,
      respectively for the full 24 weeks. All study medication will be over-encapsulated; thus,
      each patient will take two blinded capsules each day containing either placebo, MBX-102 or
      Actos®. This sample size provides the minimum number expected to ensure a power of at least
      90% in detecting a difference of 0.64% in HbA1c between the placebo and experimental
      treatment, using a two-tailed, two-sample t-test with type 1 error of 0.05, when the pooled
      standard deviation is ≤ 1.0%, and the discontinuation rate is ≤ 12.5%.
     Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus :

          -  Patients with type 2 diabetes who have been on metformin for the last 6 months and are
             taking a stable dose of metformin (≥ 1500 mg/d) as monotherapy for at least the last 3

             menses for at least 6 months and serum FSH ≥ 40 mIU/mL) or must agree to use two
             medically accepted methods of contraception including a barrier method. Depo
             contraceptives are excluded.

          -  Any history of ketoacidosis

          -  History of insulin use within last one year (insulin use while hospitalized is
             acceptable)

          -  Weight loss > 10 pounds in the three months prior to screening visit

          -  History of TZD use (Actos® or Avandia®) within 6 months of screening visit

          -  History of TZD discontinuation due to side effect or lack of efficacy
