Evaluation of Left Ventricular AutoThreshold 
      This study will collect data on a new feature for future heart failure devices via an
      external non-implantable system.
     
      ELEVATE is an acute, prospective, multi-center, feasibility study with a randomized within
      patient test sequence and pulse width, designed to characterize the performance of the Left
      Ventricular Auto Threshold feature.
     Heart Failure :

          -  Patients who are scheduled to receive a CRT-P or CRT-D, based on physician discretion

          -  Patients who are willing and capable of participating in all testing associated with
             this study

          -  Patients who are 18 or above, or of legal age to give informed consent specific to
             state and national law

         :

          -  Patients who have, or are scheduled to receive a unipolar LV pace/sense lead to be
             used with the CRT-P/CRT-D device, unless the patient has any commercially available
             epicardial leads with at least two electrodes (from one or more leads)

          -  Patients with pre-existing leads other than those specified in this investigational
             plan (unless the Investigator intends to replace them with permitted leads)

          -  Patients with a pre-existing unipolar pacemaker that will not be explanted/abandoned

          -  Patients enrolled in any concurrent study, without Boston Scientific CRM written
             approval, that may confound the results of this study

          -  Patients with a prosthetic mechanical tricuspid heart valve

          -  Women who are pregnant
